(Every Offset value is its first evidence as example)
All values are stored in Little Endian sequence, as usual in x86 architecture.
Compression method is DEFLATE using zlib.

sizeof(DWORD) = 4
sizeof(QWORD) = 8

[1] - General Format Header (sizeof: 40bytes )
Byte(23) 0x0 - 0x17 -> Containing general file headers (Version etc.)
DWORD? 0x18 -> Amount of contained files/indexes
byte(12) -> Unknown gibberish

DWORD MYTH    -> Start of every Myth package
DWORD       -> Version
DWORD 0xFD   -> Date
DWORD      -> Header Size
DWORD 0x00   -> Empty bytes
DWORD       -> Block size
DWORD       -> File count


[2] - Index Block Header (sizeof: 24bytes)
There can be multiple index blocks, they are splitted into chunks.
DWORD 0x28 -> Amount of contained files in this index, max 100/0x64
QWORD 0x2c -> Offset to the next index block header OR Zero
When a index block doesn't contain 100 index definitions, it will be padded with nulls



   [3] - FileIndex Definitions (sizeof: 34bytes )
   QWORD 0x34 -> Offset to start of Data Block of this file
   DWORD 0x3c -> Length of Data Block header (usually 0x0C)
   DWORD 0x40 -> Lenght of compressed data
   DWORD 0x44 -> Size of decompressed file
   QWORD 0x48 -> Filehash
   DWORD 0x50 -> Adler32 CRC of Data in littleEndian ( flag offset data )
   WORD  0x54 -> Compressed Flag 
   ...this repreats, until all FileIndexes are processed



   [4] - Data Block/File (sizeof: 12+Lenght bytes)
   WORD -> flag compressed ( 0008 )
   WORD -> offset  ( 0003 )
   QWORD 0xd80 -> filetime (DateTime.FromFileTime(unk); )
   BYTE(Lenght) 0xd88 -> compressed data
   ...this is repeated until all Files from FileIndexes are processed



repreat until next Index Block=0.


Pseudocode:

[1] - General Format Header (sizeof: 40bytes )

while ( repreatindex ) do
   [2] - Index Block Header (sizeof: 12bytes)

   while ( indexfilenumber~=indexfilecounter ) do
      [3] - FileIndex Definitions (sizeof: 34bytes )
   end
   while ( indexfilenumber~=indexfilecounter ) do
      [4] - Data Block/File (sizeof: 8+Lenght bytes)
   end
end
