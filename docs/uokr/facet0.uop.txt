Map is matrix of 112x64 blocks

Each file is a block of 64x64 tiles

Map sizes are width=112x64=7168 height=64x64=4096

XBlock = Int(XPos/64)
YBlock = Int(YPos/64)
Block Number = (XBlock * 64) + YBlock

Blocks are loaded from top to bottom than left to right.
Cells are loaded from blocks top to bottom then left to right.

Every files in facetX.uop is a block, execpt for the first file that contains map size.

In a block file there are 3 type of elements:

- LandTile
- Delimiter
- StaticTile

Header for all elements:

BYTE Unk1
BYTE Type1
BYTE Type2

if(Type1!=0) elem is a Delimiter, Type1 is # boundary blocks, Type 2 is Relative Direction of first block
if(Type1==0) && (Type2!=0) elem is a StaticTile, Type2 is # static blocks
else elem is a LandTile

The first element is always a LandTile, with WORD (Type1,Type2) set to current Block ID.


Then for each types continues as it follows:


for LandTile:

SBYTE Z (-127,127)
WORD New Graphic (8==Snow 5==Sea 1==Grass ...)
WORD Legacy Graphic flipped



for Delimiters: 
(it appears only after cells placed on the boundaries of the blocks if they confine with other map blocks)

SBYTE Last Cell Z
WORD Last Cell New Graphic

if( # boundary blocks>1)
  for each boundary block
	BYTE Unkk1
	BYTE 0
	BYTE Relative Direction
	SBYTE Last Cell Z
	WORD Last Cell type of terrain
  end for
endif

Relative Direction is one of this values:

1     2      7
  ----------
  |        |
  |   Map  |
0 |  Block | 3
  |        |
  |        |
  ----------
6     5      4




for StaticTile:

WORD Graphic
BYTES(2) UnkS
SBYTE Z
BYTE UnkS2
if( # static blocks>1)
  for each static block
	BYTES(3) 0
	WORD Graphic
	BYTES(2) Unk (seems always 0)
	SBYTE Z
	WORD Color ( Last byte overlaps next elem byte)
  end for
endif

File EOF is 0x00 0x00 0x00
