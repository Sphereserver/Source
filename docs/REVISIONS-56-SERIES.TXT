-Fixed: New ships were using t_multi and not t_ship. I assume this might have been causing some of the alleged "bugs" with them. They
 are now all using t_ship.

03-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #2256: Reworked NPC object throwing..
->canseelos checks now applies to overrides
->changed tag.override.rock to NPC variable THROWOBJ (can take numerical or string ID now)
->changed tag.override.dam to NPC varialbe THROWDAM min,max (can also be "THROWDAM max" for non variating damage)

->All 3 variables are available on dynamic npc or in CHARDEF
Fixed: AMMOANIM,AMMOANIMHUE,AMMOANIMRENDER,AMMOCONT, and AMMOTYPE no able to be read directly from SERV.ITEMDEF...

04-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #1904: EF_WalkCheck causing some NPCs to climb impassable terrain.

05-01-2014, Ben
Added #1638: Defmessages are accessible with <DEFMSG.msg_name>
			->Also not documented but available before: Defmessages can be set with "DEFMSG.msg_name new_msg"

09-01-2014, RanXerox (Script pack)
-Fixed some duplicate itemdef and defnames

10-01-2014, XuN
Changed: MaxFood is now writable.
Added @TradeCreate trigger for chars, fired after trade windows are created:
	SRC=The other player.
	Argo=Item wich starts the trade.
	return 1 stops the trade.
Added @DropOn_Trade trigger for items:
	Act=item adding to trade window.
	Argo=Other player.
	return 1 blocks the placement.
Added @TradeClose trigger for chars, fired before a trade window is being closed (Opossed to @TradeAccepted).
	SRC=The char closing the trade window.
Fixed: Players can now open their containers while placed on trade windows (still cannot pickup items from them, nor them).
Change: Players used to be able to open the containers of other players while they were inside a trade window, these behaviour is now controled in sphere.ini.
Added: Ini option 'TradeWindowSnooping' to handle this behaviour: 0 will open the bags, 1 will call for snooping (or deny it by your scripts).
Notes:	-For now there's still a issue causing the client to crash while someone with a trade window open closes his client or just logs off.
		-invisible (hidden) players can open trade windows to another players (but only first player will see it, this behaviour will remain, it can be fixed with @TradeCreate).

11-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #2258: Some properties returning as hex instead of decimal.

12-01-2014, XuN
Change in @TradeClose:
	Src is the player closing the window.
	Argo is the other player.
Fixed: Items being able to move while inside a container inside a trade window.
Fixed: Containers on the ground not being able to open.
Changed: Ships work again in Lost Lands.
Fixed: Disconnect not working correctly with trysrv in high privileged characters.
Added: return 1 to f_onchar_create, it blocks the creation and disconnects the client.

13-01-2014, XuN
Removed: tag.override.noto.$uid, having one tag per 1 character viewing this is insane.
Added: @NotoSend, this trigger will override the default color for status bar and character 'mouse hovering' color (Replacement for tag.override.noto.$uid)
	src=The player viewing this char
	argn1=bar/char color (0 will let the default system run)
Note: The first 7 colors are the same as NOTO_* definitions, but you can use all your hues range (however the colors does not display like in items/chars)

15-01-2014, XuN
Fixed: Items being able to move inside containers placed in trade windows (semi-fixed before)
Fixed: Gold function now updates automatically the status bar.
Fixed: Move back the character data before f_onchar_create to be able to read it again.
Added: @SeeHidden trigger (Heavy load, keep it clean) fired when a char is going to see (or not) an invisible character (just like staff see other staff members while invisible)
	argn1=Invisible/Visible (but grayed out)
	No returns for this trigger.

17-01-2014, Ben
Fixed #2244: SERV.ACCOUNT UNUSED xxx can now take any functions with the account being the default in the function.

19-01-2014, Ben
-Added #1607: "LIST.XXX.SET args,..." This will clear the list and set each arguments (separated by a ,) as an element of the specified LIST
-Added: "LIST.XXX.APPEND args,..." This acts the same as SET, but will not clear the LIST. It will add to the LIST
-Change: String parsing should now respect commas(,) as a character inside double quotes ("") instead of treating it as a separator (for most places anyways)
		This allows situations like this:   LIST.XXX.SET value1,"value2,value3",value4  to have a result of:
		LIST.XXX.0 = value1
		LIST.XXX.1 = value2,value3
		LIST.XXX.2 = value4
-Added #1787,#2142: "LIST.XXX.SORT args"  This will re-order the the list using 'args' as order method.
		'No args' or 'asc' - sorts case sensitive ascending
		'i' or 'iasc' - sorts case insensitive ascending
		'desc' - sorts case sensitive descending
		'idesc' - sorts case insensitive descending

23-01-2014, XuN
Fixed #2257: Weapons now doesn't hit from Range+1
Added tag.override.SpellTimeout to alter default .ini setting to individual players.

25-01-2014, XuN
Added BUILD function to server, wich returns the svn's build number via <serv.build>, can be used on scripts to keep up versioning and stop the code or do different things between versions in example. (Ok, caught, Ben did it!)

25-01-2014, Script-Pack (Coruja)

25-01-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2266: Trade Window memory not being removed.
-Change: LIST.xxx.FINDELEM args will now search as a string if 'args' is not a number regardless if it's inside double quotes "".

04-02-2014, XuN
Fixed #2273: Crafting skills with skf_craft not working like they should (Note: skf_scripted means the script is totally custom, for everything, so skf_craft won't work with skf_scripted).
Fixed #2267: Items in the cursor (layer_dragging) are now bounced if a target is opened to the player.

05-02-2014, XuN (Script Pack)
Fixed: changed back i_multi to the new m_ naming style in sphere_item_provisions_deed.scp.
Updated Mordaunt's House System to version 2.3.4.

09-02-2014, Ben
-Added: New variable TIMESTAMP to dynamic items and characters. (To allow for server time to upgrade to INT64)
-Moved: t_corpse.more1, t_book.more2, t_message.more2, t_eq_memory_obj.more2 to new TIMESTAMP
-Added: t_forest and t_jungle to sphere_defs.scp to fix ISNEARTYPE problems
-Fixed: <SERV.BUILD> returning date instead of revision number even though revision number is available.
-Changed: Most Interger types to INT64 for higher time support. Tags and Vars also can hold 64bit numbers. This fixes #1447

13-02-2014, XuN
Fixed: Players now become instantly GuildMasters when placing a Guild Stone instead of waiting until first DClick.
Added functionality to the ATTR_LOCKEDDOWN and ATTR_SECURED flags: locked down items should not be able to be moved, decay and be eaten by npcs (and some more default behaviour), secured items have all this checks but not the ones related to pick up and use.

Script Pack:
Modified: Iron ore now requires 0.0 Mining instead of 20.0.
Updated: New update of Mordaunt's house system.
Updated sphere_msgs.scp: Added ITEMUSE_SECURED, ITEMUSE_SECURE_ON and ITEMUSE_SECURE_OFF

15-02-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2275: NPCs walking through multi doors
-Fixed: Targets not removing when using SELF and LAST

16-02-2014, XuN
Modified @StatChange: now is working properly in EVERY stat change, and not only in the stat gain/loses
	argn1=statid (maxhits,maxmana,maxstam and maxfood are checked now too)
	argn2=the current stat value
	argn3=the new value
Fixed some new variables not working.

ScriptPack:
updated sphere_events_npcs.scp: Functions ModMaxHits/Stam/Mana to work better, they also accept += and the rest of operators.
added: sphere_attr.rar to Custom folder containing some basic behaviour for attr_secure and attr_nodroptrade (for now).
Updated Mordaunt's house system to version 2.3.7

16-02-2014, Ben
-Added #2270: summoned tag added to summoned creatures if CHARTAGS=1 in sphere.ini
Script Pack:
Corrected some defnames - i_fruit_cantelope -> i_fruit_canteloupe
 i_fruit_gourd1 -> i_fruit_gourd_yellow
 i_fruit_gourd2 -> i_fruit_gourd_green

17-02-2014, XuN
Added targetcancel function to force closing a target. 
Fixed some new variables returning hex values. 
Added functionality to RegenHits/Mana/Stam, they use the current tag.override.regen_x values 

Moved all @SkillChange triggers to CChar::Skill_SetBase, now every skill change is calling this trigger (as it should), no matter of .skill_name, .allskills, skillgains/loses and skill trains.
Fixed serv.Regenx returning value*10

18-02-2014, XuN
Regeneration Tweaks: 
	-Moved up a check to force stop in this stat, so useless checks are avoided in a function fired in each tick (each lil improve is a win!).
	-Added FOOD as a regen stat (RegenFood or tag.override.regen_3)
	-ADDED RegenValStat variables (RegenValHits, etc) to work as the RegenStat variables but with tag.override.regenval_x.
	-Removed @Hunger
	-Removed weird check that multiplied the regen time *2 if the stat was not food, it now works with the time specified in sphere.ini
	-Removed weird "Bonus" in HITS giving more delay than the default one, it should sustract it to be a real bonus? however, timers are handled in the trigger now and following the default ini settings.
	-Removed tag.override.regen(val)_x: RegenValStat is now readed inside @RegenStat and RegenStat is readed before it, cannot be modified inside without the trigger bein fired in each serv.tick. RegenStat overrides ini setting now (wich is more intuitive when scripting)
	-Added @RegenStat trigger fired after
		-local.StatID=(0=Hits,1=Mana,2=Stam,3=Food). Writable, never higher than 3.
		-local.Value=The amount of points being regenerated (or decreased in food's case). Writable, can be negative but 0 works like return 1
		-local.StatLimit=by default=<MaxStat>, allow this stat to pass the limit when regenerating, or limit it lower. Stats over this value will go down in each tick until they reach their limit. This does not work with food as food shouldn't ignore its limit (0).
		-return 1 Stop de regeneration of this stat, but not preventing future checks, to do that set the RegenHits to a very high value.
		
Added f_onaccount_connect to sphere_serv_triggers.scp, READ IT CAREFULLY, I switched the default return procedure here for safety, return 1 will allow the account connecting no matter you have checks or not.
Added LowerReq to the ReqSTR check when trying to equip items for both items and chars (It checks for LowerReqs on the item and in the character too to substract to the real ReqSTR)

23-02-2014, XuN
-Modified: CanUse is now only an item property, it also returns now values in hex format to work with it as a flag variable. 
-Sphere.ini: Added the maps 2-5 but commented out, added a few missing comments in some flags. 
-Added a check to IsTrigUsed to avoid trigger calls while serv is loading, this will improve load times and avoid several unexpected errors. 
-Removed SKTRIG_STROKE's checks from skills and moved to a new function to keep together all the checks giving more control to skills.
-Added skill_stroke() wich handles the strokes left and sound for craft and gathering skills and also a new trigger.
-Fixed amount of strokes to each crafting skill, they were random, now they have 2 strokes by default.
-Added @SkillStroke trigger:
        Local.Skill=Skill ID. (Read only).
        Local.strokes=Strokes left*     (Read/Write).
        Local.Sound=Sound to make in this stroke if any (Read/Write).
        Local.Delay=Delay until next stroke (10 = 1 second).
        return 1 Abort the skill.
        return 2* Abort the consumption of resources in this stroke.
 
        *Alchemy works different so its working with some exceptions:
                -Local.Strokes instead of going down it's going up until it reach the total strokes count, wich are equal to the amount of resources. In each stroke if no return is given resources are consumed.
                return 2 Its only allowed in alchemy skill, returning this will let the skill continue to next step (stroke, finish...) without consuming anything in this stroke.
-Modified @SkillStart: Local.CraftStrokeCnt is NOT writable for alchemy, since the skill works different and cannot be overriden this way, use @SkillStroke to add more Strokes if you want.
-Fixed #2267: MakeItem function now bounces any item in layer_dragging.
-Moved some new variables to return decimal numbers instead of strings.

23-02-2014, Mordaunt (Script Pack): 
Another update to sphere_item_provisions_deed.scp, adding new ships and moving their names to m_ too.

24-02-2014, XuN
-Fixed #2267: MakeItem function now bounces any item in layer_dragging. 

25-02-2014, XuN
Actual crafting skills (Blacksmithing, Tailoring...) now are not handled as crafting skills by the source, instead of that a SKF_CRAFT is required in their [Skill ] (Excepting Alchemy by the moment)
WARNING: From this version a update of sphere_skills is needed (read below) or crafting skills will not work.
Script pack:
	-sphere_skills.scp: Added FLAGS=SKF_CRAFT to blacksmithing,tailoring,tinkering,carpentry, cooking, bowcraft and inscription.

02-03-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2261: (script pack) Hairs/beards using wrong names (multiple scripts updated for this)

03-03-2014, XuN
Added local.Anim to @SkillStroke trigger.
Fixed wrong animations sent in each Stroke (Some are missing?).

14-03-2014, XuN
Fixed #2289:
-Added local.HitsHungerLoss for StatID 3 (Food) in the @RegenStat trigger, this value is still a percentaje and NOT the hitpoints to lose, but setting it to 0 will disable the loss of hitpoints for this character.
-Update: Damage received via Hunger have flags DAM_GOD|DAM_GENERAL|DAM_NOUNPARALYZE, if you want to change it just set Local.HitsHungerLoss to 0 and create your own damage there.

15-03-2014, Xun & Ben
Added support for packet 0xE2 (NewPacketAnimation), wich involves on updating some animations to a new packet and fixes most of the bugs on the gargoyles animations
(Throwing still needs some more updates to see the weapons coming back).

16-03-2014, Ben
Fixed #2285: FVAL returning wrong values in linux.

17-03-2014, XuN
Added @StatChange to ModStr/dex/int/food.

21-03-2014, Ben
Changed: Character creation to process 4th skill properly
Removed: EXTRASKILL.KEY and EXTRASKILL.VAL from f_onchar_create as they are being properly processed.

23-03-2014, matex
1. Fixed a crashbug in the nighly build.
2. @StatChange now receives argn1 for changes like:
0=OStr, 1=OInt, 2=ODex, 3=Food, 4=MaxHits, 5=MaxMana, 6=MaxStam, 7=MaxFood, 8=ModStr, 9=ModInt, 10=ModDex.

24-03-2014, matex
Fixed a calculation bug in Linux that e.g. had influence on Skilldelays

25-03-2014, matex
1. Fixed INT64 Expression handling.
2. Fixed a bug that occured when DIALOGCLOSE/DIALOG was sent to older clients
3. Fixed a minor bug in @StatChange

26-03-2014, matex
1. Fixed Cooking

26-03-2014, matex
1. Fixed a bug in ASC and ASCPAD with negative hex values
2. Fixed StatChange triggering for Food
3. Fixed a bug in the movement code, when climbing stairs with (BRIDGE|PLATFORM flags)
4. Updating logged out characters does'nt send a packet unless ALLSHOW is on

28-03-2014, Ben
Fixed #2296: Quality property not working.

28-03-2014, matex
1. Some internal values are still stored as 32bit (e.g. MORE1, ...). If they are negative their value
is now given as 64bit hex number so calculations,comparisions etc.. work on these values now.
2. Fixed an issue with MaxFood/Food. If MaxFood is set to 0, when read it will return the MaxFood level
of the chardefinition
3. Fixed: The server now only loads 1 Map, if you only use 1 Map.
4. Fixed: NPCs moving over obstacles when EF_WALKCHECK is disabled

29-03-2014, Ben
1. Uptaded Sphere.ini description for MAPx settings (These are now mandatory as of revision 1834)
2. Created an exception for MAP0 to load automatically even if not specified in sphere.ini (need at least 1 map to load)
3. Fixed another instance of 64 bit handling.
   (Script pack)
4. Fixed #2292: small change in teleport points for sphere_map_points0.scp and sphere_map_points1.scp
5. #2301 Few flag and typo changes done to sphere_map(2,3,5).scp

30-03-2014, Ben
Fixed system tray icon not removing on exit.

02-04-2014, matex
1. Introduced EF_NoContextMenuLOS => Will disable LOS checks for ContextMenu Use of npcs
2. Improved the standard Walkcheck stuff a bit (especially when dealing with landtiles)
3. Improved the placement code when items are dropped to ground
4. Increased standard LOS Zcheck treshold to 20
5. Changed the meaning of MOVERATE and TAG.OVERRIDE.MOVERATE. It is now a factor that scales the amount of DEX value 
   that should be taken into consideration for walking speed. E.g. if you only want 75% of the characters DEX value
   to be used in walkspeed calculations, you specify MOVERATE=75. Setting this to 100 has no effect.
6. Fixed: Backpack closing when items are dropped to corpse. (You can softscript this if you need it!)
7. Fixed: Use 1-Unit comparisons in Distance Checking. We can't use the axiom of pythagoras here because one tile has
   the same diagonal width as vertical and horizontal width. Doing real-world distance checkings messes up everything here!

08-04-2014, matex
1. Fixed HitsHungerloss. 
2. Modified behaviour of DiagonalWalkChecks when dclicking items in reach
3. If GM's add players to a party, the player is now added forcibly.
4. Fixed a possible itemleak when dropping too many items to the ground. (e.g. via newitem)
5. Fixed a null reference exception when DISPID of an item is set to something that wasnt defined via ITEMDEF. (e.g. change an item via set dispid)
6. Fixed an exception when you type 'c' in the serverconsole and have more than 100 players online ;)
7. Fixed a possible crash bug when players disconnect. Fixed players not logging out sometimes too. (this did only occur on VERY rare circumstances)

09-04-2014, XuN
-Added f_onaccount_pwchange to sphere_serv_triggers.scp
-Modified f_onaccount_create.
Both are fire now in each account creation / password change, no matter the source (serv.account xx ingame, via console, .set password...).

13-04-2014, Feeh
Fixed #2306: No lag should be noticeable after f_onserver_save call
Fixed #2293: Sphere should now read packets correctly from 6.0.1.7 clients

14/15/16-04-2014, Coruja (Script Pack)
sphere_map0.scp: 
-Removed: more generic non-OSI ROOMDEFs (huge cleanout) 
-Removed: some more weird ROOMDEFs 
-Added: missing regions for some islands 
-Fixed: incorrect GROUP set on Fire Temple, Ice Isle 
-Fixed: incorrect FLAGS set on Moonglow Zoo, Jail, Green Acres, shrine regions 
-Fixed: incorrect RECT set on Lord Britsh/Blackthorne Castle 
-Fixed: added missing 'region_flag_guarded' on Delucia 
-Fixed: added missing RECT tile on Cove, Green Acres 3 
-Small improvement on Britain and Mt Kendall RECT 
-Checkmate. Revised the entire script, everything is clean, fixed and categorized now 

sphere_map1.scp: 
-Moved: Solen Hive region from map0 to map1 (apparently Solen Hive exists only on Trammel) 

sphere_map_points0.scp: 
-Fixed: Delucia Passage teleporting to incorrect position 

sphere_map_points1.scp:
-Updated to match changes of previous sphere_map_points0.scp commit 

sphere_map0_ml.scp: 
-Moved: temp moved all SE/ML/HS regions to this file. Since it have only a few regions, maybe it's better disband this file and move all regions to their correct map file (map0, map3 and map4) 
sphere_map4.scp: 
-Small update on Tokuno Islands regions 

sphere_newb.scp: 
-Updated all skill to match OSI default starting items and colors. 
PS: Still need a few more additional items for professions (Warrior, Necromancer, Paladin, Samurai, Ninja) -> I can't update this for now, sphere only have support to skills on sphere_newb.scp,
	 but not for professions (it would be great if someone give a little help with this on the source :D) 

17-04-2014, XuN
Moved tag.override.SpellTimeOut to SpellTimeOut.
Changed: Now @Create trigger can be fired on EVENTS too. Note: be aware of the calls order (SkillClass -> added events -> ini -> chardef (for chars)),
		you can't retrieve the <str> ie in a custom event because it's fired before the @Create in the CHARDEF (which is the one setting it), this trigger
		doesn't have return 1 so if you set str=15 in your event it will be overwrited with the stat given in the chardef.

Changed all the variables in the 'New Variables' thread to make them readable not only from items/chars but from their BaseDef. That means, no need of IncreaseSwingSpeed
		under the @Create, you can set them like the NAME property. Added some variables too, read the post.

Script Pack:
Updated some scripts to reflect the variable's changes:
		-items/sphere_item_artifacts.scp
		-items/sphere_item_artifacts_minor.scp
		-items/sphere_item_artifacts_tokuno.scp
		-items/sphere_item_magic_jewelry.scp
		-items/sphere_item_provisions_armor.scp
		-items/sphere_item_provisions_clothing.scp
		-items/sphere_item_provisions_jewelry.scp
		-items/sphere_item_provisions_shields.scp
		-items/sphere_item_resources.scp
		-items/sphere_item_typedef_equipitem.scp
		-npcs/sphere_monsters.scp
		-npcs/sphere_monsters_custom.scp

sphere_item_vegetation.scp: Commented out TDATA3=i_vanilla_bean since it does not exist.

sphere_item_provisions_deeds.scp:
		-Fixed line 64: RESOURCES=i_deed,m_stone_and_plaster_house.
		-Changed all of the remaining i_multi_foundation_* to m_foundation_*.

sphere_item_provisions_armor.scp: changed all i_leather from gargoyle leather armor to i_hides_cut (lines 4704 - 5000).

For a complete change's track visit http://scripts.spherecommunity.net/

18-04-2014, XuN
-Fixed a Typo in sphere_item_typedef_equipitem.scp (SeldRepair -> SelfRepair)
-Updated sphere_monsters.scp to add stats to c_tiger and changed changed actual c_tiger to c_tigress
-Added item 03ec7 to sphere_item_ship_parts.scp to link it with c_tiger
-Updated sphere_defs.scp to reflect c_tiger and c_tigress as mounts.

19-04-2014, Ben
Changed: CANUSE flags can now be properly set on ITEMDEF and dynamic items (ITEMDEFs value is given to dynamic items on creation)
Fixed 1565: Removed TAG.OVERRIDE.RANGE from items and chars.
			Changed RANGE so it can be read/write on items and char (Dynamic object value overrides basedef value. Highest value between weapon and char is used in combat)
			RANGEH and RANGEL are also available as readonly variables for dynamic items and char now
			Added FIGHTRANGE to chars to replace old RANGE (readonly and returns the highest value used for combat)

19-04-2014, XuN
-Fixed 0002310: Changed t_weapon_bow in Throwing Items (sphere_item_provisions_weapons.scp) to t_weapon_throwing.
-Fixed 0002309: Mounted characters (humans & elfs) are not sending New Animation packet anymore.
-Fixed 0002294: Every CAN-related property (dye, enchant, flip...) is now working in base items instead of inheriting from DispID.
-Some internal changes related to IsHuman: changed it to IsPlayableCharacter and splitted it into IsHuman || IsElf || IsGargoyle and changed its calls.
	-Same for IsHumanID -> IsPlayableID = (IsHumanID || IsElfID || IsGargoyleID)
	-Fixed: Gargoyles are no longer able to ride anything.

21-04-2014, Ben
Fixed #2014: memory_aggreived not being set on players
Fixed #2311: t_light_lit not decaying as normal

23-04-2014, Ben
Fixed #1500: Quote causing problems for ARGS and ARGV. This is how is will work now in a simple function called TEST...
	-.TEST "a", b, "c,d"		Output: ARGS = a	ARGV[0] = a	ARGV[1] = b	ARGV[2] = c,d
	-.TEST "a"e, b, "c,d"		Output: ARGS = a	ARGV[0] = a	ARGV[1] = b	ARGV[2] = c,d
	-.TEST e"a", b, "c,d"f		Output: ARGS = e"a", b, "c,d"f	ARGV[0] = e"a"	ARGV[1] = b	ARGV[2] = c,d
	-.TEST f"a"g"h,i",b,e"c,d"	Output: ARGS = f"a"g"h,i",b,e"c,d"	ARGV[0] = f"a"g"h,i"	ARGV[1] = b	ARGV[2] = e"c,d"
	*All ARGV will now show even if quotes are found in first argument.
	*if quotes are found as the first character of an argument, what is found in the quote is the argument
	*if a quote is found but not at the beginning, or no quote is found, whole string is used as argument.

Fixed #1739: ">" in QVAL's condition is now processed properly as "bigger than" instead of the end of QVAL

26-04-2014, Ben
Changed: TAG.OVERRIDE.DOORSOUND_CLOSE for DOORCLOSESOUND
		TAG.OVERRIDE.DOORSOUND_OPEN for DOOROPENSOUND
		TAG.OVERRIDE.PORTCULISSOUND for PORTCULISSOUND
Added: DOOROPENID to Items for new door system.
Fixed #2054: Should now be able to make any door work with new scripting options (default still works if no new data is found)
	-Game Item: (if no info here, use ITEMDEF info)
		-DOOROPENID=0676 //ID to change into (no DEFNAME as it's only used for dispid)
		-MOREX=-1 // X position change
		-MOREY=1  // Y position change
		-DOORCLOSESOUND=00f3 closing sound
		-DOOROPENSOUND=00eb opening sound
	-ITEMDEF: (if no info here and on game item, use default system)
		-TDATA1=00eb00f3 //WORD open | WORD close (sounds)
		-TDATA2=0676 //ID to change into (no DEFNAME as it's only used for dispid)
		-TDATA3=-1 // X position change
		-TDATA4=1  // Y position change

29-04-2014, Ben
-Fixed: VAR,TAG and LOCAL causing instability in the server with huge amount of data. Limit of 2048 caracters has been set.

30-04-2014, XuN
-Added SpellCount function for Spellbooks (Read Only).
-Tweaked Attacker system:
	Added attacker.add uid / attacker.delete uid. Self explanatory
	Changed: attacker.elapsed/dam are now writable

02-05-2014, XuN
Updated house deeds in sphere_template_vend.scp (Thx azmanomer).
Fixed: local.anim in @SkillStroke was readable but not writable. Fixed also alchemy skill sending anim 0 instead of no anim.
Rewrote totally the combat system for npcs ( I may have missed something but it's mostly done ):
	memory_war_targ is no longer used for npc combats (in the source) but is still present for scripting backwards, Sphere now uses the 'Attacker' system and a new variable added to it 'Threat'.
	added @CombatStart, @CombatEnd, @CombatAdd triggers, return 1 stops actions. (not recomendable, the actions will be called over and over obviously trying to start/add or end the combat).
	Attacker system (Added/Changed):
					NPC_AI_THREAT flag variable to ini enabling the use of the threat variable for choosing targets in combat (for npcs).
		General:	Attacker.add uid	(Write)		Adds the given UID as new enemy in the attacker list for this char.
					Attacker.Delete uid	(Write)		Remove UID from the attacker list.
					Attacker.Target		(Read)		Returns the current best target, these are the priorities: Threat -> Distance -> LOS.
					Attacker.ID uid		(Read)		Returns the 'n' id of the given uid (if in the attacker list, returns -1 if not).
		From ID:	Attacker.n.Threat 	(Read/Write)Gets or Sets the Threat of this character against me, Threat is most important factor to select a target. (this gets updated even if npc_ai_threat is disabled, but its not used)
					Attacker.n.Dam 		(Read/Write)Made it writable.
					Attacker.n.Elapsed	(Read/Write)Made it writable.
I'm updating the wiki with this new information also.

03-05-2014, Ben
-Fixed #2325: Corpse with morez > 0 were able to be draged
-Fixed #1781: Rejected moves should not count as a move for fast walk detection.

06-05-2014, Feeh
-Modified #2328: Dye tub now call @Dye on the dyed item
	ARGN1		= the hue value (r/w)
	ARGN2		= sound effect (r/w) (default 023e)
	ARGO		= the item that originated the dye target
	SRC			= who is dying the item 
	RETURN 1	= stop internal dying/sound. hue changes made from script will take place
	This will allow to change Dye behaviour for specific items without having to track the item id from other methods/scripts
	
07-05-2014, XuN
-Updated 'guards' defname in sphere_defs.scp, guards have other ID since long time ago.
-Added exception lines to the new Attacker_* functions so if something goes wrong... errors are more descriptive. Also fixed some exceptions appearing now.
-Attacker.elapsed -1 means no attacker decay.
-Fixed #2332: Range, also RangeL/RangeH not working as it should after the variables changes. Also made them return in decimal values instead of hexadecimal.
-Made BloodColor writable.
-Modified Guards system:
	Modified @CallGuards trigger for players calling separatelly than NPCs.
	This trigger will fire one time on the Player calling guards per each possible target, argn3 is set to 1 if the target is hostile, however if set to 0 nothing will happen, if this is set to 1 the character will be attacked by guards.
-Fixed guards dissapearing after calling them. They also stick now to the attacker system (if defined) being easier to create custom guards (changing how and when are they called will come in next commits)
-Added ini setting GuardsOnMurderers (1 by default), if set to 0 will only attack criminals, if set to 1 will attack criminals and murderers.
-Fixed: GuardsInstantKill now set hits to 1 before hit to ensure the kill, it was acting as instant hit instead of instant kill
-Changed: Moved the instant kill ouside the 'teleport' check, to ensure its using it everytime and not only if target.distance > 1
-Switched 2 checks to ensure that guards are not called on guards.
-Added a check in OnNoticeCrime() to avoid guards becoming criminals if send to attack any good character.

08-05-2014, XuN
Changed @Criminal trigger, now it's being called in every criminal call instead of in OnNoticeCrime(), return 1 prevents the criminal action, argn1 is how many time will the criminal status last.
Fixed CanUse returning weird values when ITEMDEF didn't have any value.
Added WeightReduction to item's weight calculations, so a item with 5.0 weight and 10 Weight Reduction will result in 4.5 weight stones.

09-05-2014, XuN
-Fixed an exception when attacking blue characters.
-Created a new vector-list to handle Notoriety: instead of having 2-5+ checks per second (and nearby character), the notoriety will be saved in this list to reduce a lot the loading related to this function.
-Added NotoTimeout to ini (default 30) to set the 'decay' for notoriety in each character for another one. However the list will be reseted in each criminal/murderer action/karma change/incognito cast.
-Fixed some Karma messages being shown even if the trigger returned 1. Fixed #2297: Trigger's returns were working wrong and any value given to argn1 was not really being considered by sphere unless return != 0.
-Fixed #2290: Now crafting skills cast animations and sounds when starting and in every Skill_Stroke > 1 (1 is the last, note that skill_stroke is called before the stroke ends, not before starting it).
-Removed SKF_NOANIM check after the @SKillStroke trigger, so even if the skill have this flag, it won't pass any value to local.anim, but if you want to have animation for a specific character, then you can write it.

09-05-2014, Ben
-Improved how RangeH/L 'fix' work and making them readable by dynamic items in every situation.

09-05-2014, Feeh
-Fixed #2326: Some mt_* CAN flags were not allowed to be assigned after char/npc creation. It should be assignable anytime from now

10-05-2014, XuN
Fixed #2334. Also forced that any character called to be a guard ( Argn1 in @CallGuards ) have brain_guard no matter what it is really.
Fixed #2333. Also fixing @Attack trigger blocking any other actions too when returning 1.
Added #1765 :New ini setting: AttackingIsaCrime making criminal any character without any damage, only attacking.

10-05-2014, Feeh (thanks to Ben)
Modified: @Dye is now called on more situations on both Items and Chars:
	-Script color changes					(SRC/ARGO = Server)
	-Dye tubs (t_dye_vat) color changes		
	-@Create color assignment				(SRC/ARGO = Server)
	-Staff .xcolor command					(SRC/ARGO = Server)

22-05-2014, Ben
Changed: char's AGE property now returns in days instead of seconds (CREATE is already in seconds)

23-05-2014, Feeh
Changed: Harvesting skills (Fishing/Mining/Lumberjacking) can now pack or place the harvested resource at feet
	Override ACTARG2 on either @SkillSuccess and @Success (remember that @SkillSuccess is called first)
	ACTARG2 = 0 -> Put the resource at feet
	ACTARG2 = 1 -> Pack the resource

26-05-2014, Ben
Removed and made permanent EF_FixKillTrigger, EF_WalkCheck, EF_NewPositionCheck, and EF_DiagonalWalkCheck

26-05-2014, matex
Fixed a small bug in the code that adds a player forcibly when GM's add to party.

27-05-2014, XuN
Changed: new order for @Create trigger in items, now the order is this; Itemdef, @ItemCreate for characters ( if proceed ), TEvents, EventsItem and Typedef
Fixed #2350: Guards working in non-guarded areas when GuardsOnMurderes=1
Fixed #2352: AttackingIsACrime checks making criminal when it shouldn't
Fixed #2351: Murderers never becoming criminal (didn't need before GuardsOnMurderers).
Fixed #2353: Wrong speech color for tillerman.
Fixed #2349. Also improved the Attacker_GetID() functions a bit.
Fixed #1491: region_flag_no_pvp not working fine. Also a wrong SkillUseQuick(tactics) related to it.
Added a new function to removed chars so they are being removed from attacker list's characters of their attacker's list. There's no reason to keep a not existing character.
Added ContextMenuLimit option to sphere.ini defining the maximum amount of options in each menu.

29-05-2014, XuN
Combat target for players will be 'reseted' after attacking a character, instead of checking for the best target ... so it now gives priority to player's choices.
Changed attacker.target also to reflect the changes and return the direct value instead of calling Fight_FindBestTarget().
Changed the way t_spawn_char creates the characters, they are now placed and the spawnitem is asigned before calling NPC_LoadScript() so, both spawn and regions can be read in the @Create (this can simulate a @CharCreate for spawns but on the character instead of the item.)
Changed summon to be placed also before the @Create.

01-16-2014, XuN
Changed @Attack: added Argn1 for npcs to allow modifying the initial 'Threat'.
Changed: Pets forced to attack (kill and attack commands) now adds 1000( plus the actual highest threat amount) to argn1 in the @Attack trigger.
Changed: Pets changes target instantly when attack is called always if NPC_AI_THREAT is off.
Updated sphere_defs_2.scp with m_keep.

06-06-2014, Feeh
Added: #2340 Sectors now do have flags, look at sphere_defs.scp for more info
Fixed: #2360
Fixed: BADSPAWN command was not stopping when the first bad spawn was found

11-06-2014, Ben
Added #2359: REGEN in REGIONRESOURCE can now have a range as argument.
Fixed #1827: Axis strip now works as case insensitive.
Fixed #2307: REGION_FLAG_INSTA_LOGOUT will now work in ROOMDEFs

23-06-2014, Feeh
Fixed #2366
Added: SERV.FUNCTIONS.x, it can display every available function and its access plevel
		Usage:
		SERV.FUNCTIONS.COUNT		- Return how many functions are available in your server
		SERV.FUNCTIONS.32			- Return the 33th function (zero-based)
		SERV.FUNCTIONS.32.PLEVEL	- Return the minimum access plevel to use this function
		SERV.FUNCTIONS.add1			- Return the minimum access plevel to use 'add1' function

1-07-2014, Ben
Updated: spherecrypt.ini with client 7.0.35
Changed: gold will now be taken from pack first and then from bank in a purchase
Fixed #2370: Not being able to walk up some stairs AGAIN!
Fixed #2371: Vendor buy/sell dialogs will now display in the same order as their templates

08-07-2014, XuN
Fixed, Updated and Improved the .dupe on both items and characters:
	- Added new variable's copy for both items and chars.
	- Duping characters now works fine: Stats, Skills, Tags, Items is copied now, by default every copied item have attr |= attr_newbie for security, using .dupe 1 will copy the items 'as they are' without mods.
	- Using .dupe 0 will create the mount's memory (if any) empty, so when npc dies... no mount appears, .dupe 1 will create another new duped mount character.

12-07-2014, Ben
Fixed #2372: Weightreduction causing errors when calculating weight.
Fixed a small issue with updating amount on items.

17-07-2014, XuN
Fixed #2345: Wrong titles for Elder/Legendary Bushido and Ninjitsu skills, updated sphere_msgs.scp.
Readjusted the skill ranges for skill titles according to http://www.uoguide.com/Skill_Title .
Added SKILL_TITLES to sphere_defs.scp to adjust the range for the skill's titles.

19-07-2014, XuN
SKF_GATHER enabled, only fishing will have this flag in sphere_skills.scp, so now @Stroke and @SkillStroke can be used.
@(Skill)Start and @(Skill)Stroke now use ACT as a reference for the worldgem.
@(Skill)Start have local.GatherStrokeCnt ONLY for gathering skills.
Fishing delay is now 8.0 (1 stroke), the splash animation is softcoded in sphere_skills.scp since working with timerf in the source will complicate things a little.
In the 'long and not even started' proccess of softcoding skills ... the sounds/animations (for fishing!) will be added in the skill's triggers.
Return 1 in @Stroke will fire @Abort.
Added RANGE for gathering skills determining the max distance for the proccess (added RANGE=4 for fishing in sphere_skills.scp)

22-07-2014, XuN
Removed default sysmessage when reading / writing Experimental and Option Flags directly ingame or from script.
SKF_GATHER is a generic flag now: Skills with this flag will automatically call for @Stroke and override default behaviour (no more calls to STAGE == SKTRIG_STROKE in the skill's function).
Added Range and SKF_GATHER to mining and lumberjacking, softcoded some code related to SKILL_STROKES of them (and fishing also) in sphere_skills.scp.


02-08-2014, XuN
Changed tag.override.breath.dam to Breath.Dam
Added Breath.Hue overriding the default explosion color for breaths.
Added @PartyLeave: return 1 stops the action
Modified Dir function, <DIR <src>> will return the dir you should have to face <src> (Same as FACE <SRC> but not turning you, just returning the DIR value).
Added Reveal (flags): Reveal statf_hidden will reveal player if has statf_hidden, same for sleeping, insubstantial and invisible. 
	Sum this flags to reveal more than 1 invis state (ie: statf_invisible|statf_sleeping will reveal player if any of these flags is present on him).
	Reveal -1 will reveal everything (Even invis staff).

Changed: SpellFlag_NoUnparalyze flag in s_explosion will affect explosion potions.
Changed: Argo is now writable ( Remember that Argo can only be accessed via script and not ingame ).
Added SysMessagef function accepting text with strings and limited to 3 args. Example: sysmessagef "Hello %s, I have a %s and %s, be aware of me!",<src.name>,<findlayer.1.name>,<findlayer.2.name>
	It needs the text to be inside " " to create the first arg with it, but first and last quotes will be removed (only these 2).
Changed: SkillUseQuick is now RW and not only Read because not always need a return.
SpellEffect ( CChar::Spell_Effect_Create() ) now set as NEW the UID of the spell's rune, IE: 'spelleffect s_poison,2000,<src>' ... 'new.remove ' will remove the poison rune.
Added @(item)MemoryEquip firing when equiping any item in memory layers (Not normal @Equip-able items), in example: paralyze rune, criminal memory ...
	argn1 = layer on which the item will be equiped.
	return 1 deletes the item and prevents default actions.
Fixed 'Range' not being properly defaulted to skill's defaults when no value is in the skill.
Fixed SKF_GATHER skills going to negative values when local.gatherstrokecnt=1.

Added SKF_FIGHT to fighting skills in sphere_skills.scp.
Fixed ADV_RATEs for parrying being too high and causing the skill to not gain.

Minor changes to 0x20 packet.

Modified ResPhysical to work like armor.lo. Modified Armor to be writable (only for items) and also Dam (for items and chars) and changed them from BYTE to WORD.
Moved Weight to dynamic items too.
Fixed bad definition of t_stone_town type in the f_stonesys_gettypename function inside sphere_genericstone_functions, should be <DEF.STONECONFIG_TYPENAME_TOWN>.
Added ColorInvis, ColorHidden and ColorInvisSpell to sphere.ini overriding (if specified) the default color for .invis, hidding or the invis spell/potion.

Fixed items remaining on the ground on Enhanced Client when equipping them via double click.
Fixed PacketMapChange being fired when DClicking an item and turning around (without OF_DClickNoTurn enabled). This should decrease the amount of rubberband effects.

NOTE: The following changes are supossed to be usefull to redo the default combat system, but not using the new trigger will make the new script and the following code useless so this is not forced,
	just a help to rewrite the actual sys without doing a whole new combat system allowing to tweak each check.
NOTE2: These changes are in 'beta' proccess, please report any problem to bugtracker.
NOTE3: If I was not clear enough... this makes no difference with current systems if the new trigger and dam_flag are not used.

Added DAM_FIXED to sphere_defs.scp: this flag will make sphere asume that the argn1 value in @gethit is the final damage and will not do any formula calculations over it,
	will only cast sounds,animations, blood, memories, attacker.n.% update and @GetHit trigger.
	It also have some effects in the hit proccess (explained under).
Changed: combat functions (hit & gethit ) to allow easy override via script with DAM_FIXED giving a better way to override the default combat system while knowing also the resulting damage
Added sphere_combat.scp with the override of the default combat system and explanations of the new changes also.
Added Swing Types in sphere_defs.scp for combat compatibility.
	//  SWING_INVALID = target is invalid, searching another one.
	//  SWING_EQUIPPING = swing made.
	//  SWING_READY = can't take my swing right now. but i'm ready
	//  SWING_SWINGING = taking my swing now.
Added Swing variable for characters setting or retrieving the SWING_TYPE they currently have.
Added FullTrigger function working like 'call' to call triggers with full support with old args and locals making possible to override default triggers with your parameters.
	FullTrigger must be write only to avoid some problems so I added the return value in local.return, which can be readed after the trigger call.
	Usage: FullTrigger @DClick
Added @HitCheck trigger just in the beggining of the hit allowing to use only custom combat checks (default ones are in the supplied script) or to override the whole combat formulas.
	- Args
		Argn1 = SWING_TYPE. Swing will be set to this value after the trigger so you can 'jump' between swings with or without default checks.
		Argn2 = DAM_FLAGS
	- Returns
		return -1 SWING_INVALID
		return 0 default checks
		return 1 will make Sphere return the SWING_TYPE applied in argn1, so if you are in SWING_SWINGING and you set argn1 to SWING_EQUIPPING you'll have to start the hit proccess again.
				(Note, argn1 there will NOT set SWING to it's value).
	- Special returns will be fired when SWING_TYPE = SWING_SWINGING & FLAGS & DAM_FIXED
		return 0 will generate the default damage formula and flags (if not set via argn2) and then call the gethit function without DAM_FIXED applied.
		return 2 will finish the hit function AS IT IS and will NOT call the gethit function (this asume you are creating the damage, formulas and calling .damage function).
Note: Using new DAM_FIXED or return 1, -1 will obviously NOT call any skillgain, memory change, exp, attacker update, notoriety, actions, etc. Using this will (almost) make you to rewrite the whole system as shown in the given script.

03-08-2014, XuN
Modified Dir and Face functions (and the not soft-coded functions) to prevent loading all items in each dir change, even if they were not send to clients they were consuming resources in the serve

04-08-2014, Ben
Fixed #2362: Old attacker code interfering with new code.
Added: BREAK and CONTINUE to script loops. (CONTINUE will skip to the next iteration, BREAK will exit the loop)

06-08-2014, XuN
Fixed a problem causing Staff with gm body (03db) to stick with this corpse and blocking following commands because of the '=' automatically appearing, Update is called when setting the body value.
Added party.create msg,uid(s) where msg is 0/1 sending default sysmessages or not (usefull when forcing groups 0 = disable ), the following args (up to 9 more) is/are the players to add to this party.
Changed all party triggers (Except the @PartyRemove when argn1=1, which means informative remove when a @PartyDisband has been fired before and is in proccess now) returnable to stop their following code.
Fixed crash bug introduced in last patch.

08-08-2014, XuN
Multiples items overplaced not doing their 'effects', ie: spell fields, because of returning the code after finding the first item. All of the changes related to this can be overriden in @Step and @itemStep.
	- Paralyzed characters won't move to any t_telepad or t_moongate location if they are freezed or stoned.
	- t_shrine was blocking the effect of any other items in its location, so now if players place any field or explotion or whatever upon it = free reskill.
Added #2380: Spell Fields check now the Z when creating, adjusting their position to it.
	Moved the FIX: code to FixZ() for CItem and CChar.
	Added also a bool bForceFix to MoveTo forcing a FixZ() after the Object positioning, updated the whole pack of *::MoveTo() to accept the new bool.
Fixed #2381: Reveal not removing the memory when spell s_invisibility was casted (layer 39) (only removing potion effect (layer 44)).
Added m_defenseBase and m_defenseRange splitting up the m_attackBase/Ranged properly between armor and damage instead of using it for everything.
Enabled some disabled variables for KR client status bar.

09-08-2014, Ben
Fixed: Another issue with stairs...

10-08-2014, Ben
Fixed #2383: Weight not changing after a baseid change resulting in weird weight calculations.
Fixed #2382: Reveal causing server freeze.
Fixed: Paperdoll not updating body color when using invis spell

11-08-2014, matex
Added EF_NoDiagonalCheckLOS = 00000001. Disables Diagonal Passage checks for legacy LOS. (Not advanced LOS)
Added FACING function to objects which will give you the direction the object/npc would turn to if it looks towards SRC.
Optionally FACING takes a location or uid as argument. This UID/location replaces SRC in that context.

16-08-2014, Ben
Fixed #2386: Ghosts can't pass through doors anymore
Fixed #2385: No swing animation during combat, @HitTry doesn't fire.
Fixed #2387: Hunger/starving causing wrong damage.
Fixed #2380: Field spells creating items on incorrect Z. (Caused by the Fix funtion. Fix should now work better in all places)

18-08-2014, XuN
Fixed some problems with ResPhysical.
Added @Resurrect trigger:
	- argn1 is the hitpoints value the char will have when resurrected (RW).
	- argo is the corpse (if any near) (R).
Fixed some items removed from view in some circumstances.

26-08-2014, Ben
Fixed: SLEEP causing NPCs to die with double corpse.

04-09-2014, matex
Fixed: character hue not updating when Char is revealed.

04-09-2014, matex
Xun made the WEIGHT property on writable on items. I renamed it BASEWEIGHT because we need
WEIGHT not to return the weight of a single instance but also of the whole stack in scripts.
So WEIGHT is read-only again. If you want to change the base weight, use BASEWEIGHT.

07-09-2014, matex
Fixed: Armor not updating when BaseID is changed on an Item.
Fixed: EF_FixCanSeeInClosedConts always enabled in Debug builds
Fixed: Walking code. Only stair statictiles are priorized now near the map-surface. Platform tiles not. (players were falling through map surface)
Fixed: Order in which NPCvendor boxes are sent to the player (display bug)

10-09-2014, matex
Refactored some of the walking code. You now need NPC's and Players to have MT_INDOORS definitely for them to be able
to go under static tiles.
Changed MT_INDOORS to MT_NOINDOORS. Think that makes more sense.

13-09-2014, matex
Built in LOCAL.ArrowHandled for @HIT, @HITMISS
so if you set this to something different from 0 in the triggers
the server will not BOUNCE drop the arrow to the Target's feet on MISS
or bounce it to the Targets BP on hit. You can handle this yourself.
If you do nothing, the arrow will be deleted if Local.ArrowHandled != 0
You can prevent it from being deleted by moving it in the Trigger.

13-09-2014, Ben
Fixed #2397: Return 1 should now prevent the guards from coming under @callguards in all instances

01-10-2014, Coruja

	-[sphere_msgs.scp] Removed some alchemy internal messages
	WARNING: Make sure to update your scripts following these changes, otherwise alchemy skill will not work anymore.

02-10-2014, Coruja
Changed: Cartography skill is now a craft skill too. The craft now uses default MAKEITEM instead the hardcoded DRAWMAP.
	-The skill is now used clicking on it's tool (mapmaker's pen) instead click on the skill button or blank map.
	-Removed obsolete DRAWMAP hardcoded function. The behavior is now softcoded using @Create on map items.
	-[sphere_skills.scp] Softcoded the client skill button behavior, it comes disabled by default
	-[sphere_item_profession_cartographer.scp] Added new items for maps and mapmaker's pen
	-[sphere_defs.scp] Added new hardcoded typedef 't_carpentry' used on the tool to open the skill menu
	-[sphere_template_vend.scp] Updated NPC Mapmaker vendor buy/sell template list
	-[sphere_skillmenu.scp] Updated cartography skillmenu

07-10-2014, Coruja
Added: New formula for dragon breath damage on NPCs brain_dragon, it's now NPC_CurrentHitpoints * 0.16 (if BREATH.DAM property is set, it will override the internal damage).
Fixed #2405: Players becoming criminal when attack someone on the same guild.
Changed: Increased NPCs view range from 12 to 14 tiles. This also affects the range to call guards.
Changed: Cooking skill is now a craft skill.
	-The skill is now used clicking on it's tool instead click on the raw food and select a fire source (but the fire source still needed in range).
	-[sphere_defs.scp] Added new hardcoded typedef 't_cooking' used on the tool to open the skill menu.
	-[sphere_item_profession_cooking_barkeep_baker.scp] Added typedef t_cooking on i_fry_pan, i_flour_sifter, i_rolling_pin. Also fixed many food items using wrong MOREZ

08-10-2014, XuN
Added Argn3 value in @UserWarMode telling Sphere to remove Attacker list after execution.
Added a description of deletion in argn1 for @CombatDelete:
		0 = Forced (Blocked attack, default uncategorized actions...)
		1 = Max fight time has reached (Elapsed)
		2 = Distance/LOS
		3 = The character is no longer existing
		4 = Forced via attacker.delete methods (ingame/script)
Fixed ResPhysical no showing the correct values in the Status gump.
Fixed Stoned players being able to dismount. 

09-10-2014, Ben
Fixed: RETURN 6 not halting scripts when inside an IF statement.
Fixed: .fix will now default to the first terrain elevation instead of lowest Z possible.

10-10-2014, XuN
Added local.anim and local.animDelay (this last one only working for classic clients) to @HitTry, so animations can be disabled and fired later in @hit (to remove the odd behaviour with new animation packets, which doesn't have delay).
Added OF_NODClickTarget to ini, enabling this will not make the cursor appear as a target when double clicking weapons to equip them.


11-10-2014, Ben
Added #2394: SMSG_DEF_UNICODE, MSG_DEF_UNICODE, IMSG_DEF_UNICODE to sphere_msgs.scp. If set to 1, messages will be sent in unicode unless overwriten with the the mode in @hue,font,mode.

11-10-2014, Coruja
[sphere_defs.scp] Added new BFONT_* colors to use on HTML texts. Values already match most colors used on OSI dialogs.
[sphere_map0.scp] Fixed duplicated a_dungeon_10 AREADEF (the last one was renamed to a_dungeon_19).
[sphere_map_points0/1.scp] Fixed Hythloth entrance teleport.

12-10-2014, Ben
Fixed #2416: @Enter region trigger will now fire after NPC stats are set in all instances.
Fixed: local.return not being set in FULLTRIGGER if no args were specified.

14-10-2014, Coruja
Added: New MAGICF_NOCASTFROZENHANDS setting on sphere.ini. If enabled, this will prevent cast spells if the char got paralyzed holding something on hands.
Added: Missing behavior for SPELLCHANNELING item property. It's now working fine, items using this property won't get unequiped when casting spells.
Fixed: Triggers @Start (spell trigger) and @SpellCast (char trigger) unequiping weapons and playing the spell cast animation even when the cast got denied using 'return 1'.
Changed: Updated width/radius internal values for area/field spells (nothing really changed, just hardcoded values already set on sphere_spells.scp to be the default internal value if there's no value defined on scripts to override it).
Changed: Create Food spell is now target-based. Using SPELLFLAG_TARG_* the food will be created on ground at target location, otherwise it will be created on caster backpack.
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Added new messages for 'spell_create_food' and 'spell_try_frozenhands'.
[sphere_spells.scp]: Removed target flags on Create Food spell. It will now create the item on backpack by default.
[sphere_dialog.scp]: Added missing description for 'nodispose' on help guide.

16-10-2014, Coruja
Fixed #1860: Spell cast behavior now check for spellbook/mana/reags before check for anti-magic region.
Changed: return 6 on @SpellCast trigger now will skip anti-magic region check too.
Changed: Polymorph spell now doesn't change char status anymore. If needed, this behavior can be softcoded using @Success on Polymorph spell (ACTARG2 [read/write] is the new body ID)
[sphere_spells.scp]: Added missing spellflag_noprecast and cancel functionality for polymorph spell. If used while already polymorphed, it will remove the polymorph effect.

17-10-2014, Coruja
Added: New MediumCanHearGhosts feature on sphere.ini (default value: 100.0). At this Spirit Speak skill level players can understand ghosts speech instead hear 'oOOoO ooO'.

Fixed: MSG_DEF_COLOR def on sphere_msgs.scp not working when the char click on itself.
Fixed: Char flag [stone] overriding [frozen] and [tame] overriding [npc]. Also fixed [tame] only showing inside guarded regions.
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Added new defs to customize EMOTE color/font/unicode. These changes are global, and EMOTE still not support @color,font,unicode on individual messages yet.
[sphere_map_points[0/1].scp]: Fixed 'Lighthouse' teleport not working.

18-10-2014, Coruja
Added: New VendorTradeTitle feature on sphere.ini. If enabled, it will show the job title on vendor names (eg: Alan the Carpenter).
Changed: Corpses now will be created with TAG.OVERRIDE.MAXWEIGHT already set (value is always the same as char MAXWEIGHT). This will prevent overweight problems if someone drop many heavy items on a player corpse and then resurrect the player just to make him get stuck.

20-10-2014, Coruja
Changed: Scissors won't cut hair/beard anymore. Now proper items are needed to do it, like items usually found on NPC Barber (hair restyling, hair dye, etc).
Changed: Sewing Kit can't be used directly on bolts of cloth anymore. To use the bolts of cloth we must cut it using scissors first.
Fixed #2421: Using scissors on bolts of cloth now will convert it properly to cloth.
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Added new message 'loot_criminal_act' when opening corpses to warn that looting items will be a criminal action.

22-10-2014, Coruja
Added: Missing functionality of EF_PetSlots feature on sphere.ini. It's working now, but still need some testing and final tweaks.
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Added new messages for petslots_try_*

23-10-2014, Coruja
Fixed: Minor EF_PetSlots issues. Now everything is working fine and it's ready to use.
Changed: NPCs using BRAIN=brain_animal_trainer won't give food to players anymore (but still able to feed pets nearby).

23-10-2014, XuN
Changed Argn3 in @UserWarMode to force a war/peace status ( 0 = do nothing, 1 = force peace, 2 = force war).
NOTE: Argn3 is no longer deleting Attacker's lists, to do so use attacker.clear.

26-10-2014, Coruja
Changed: Many improvements on pet stables behavior.
	-Also the max limit of pets that the NPC can hold for a player now is based on player skills (Animal Taming + Animal Lore + Veterinary). Usually it can hold 2~8 pets.
	-If TAG.MAXPLAYERPETS is set on the NPC, it will override the formula and will be default value for all players.
Added: Account character creation now will create characters with MAXFOLLOWERS=5 already set.
Fixed: House customization engine creating doors using wrong type 't_door' instead 't_door_locked'.
Fixed: EMOTE_DEF_* defs not working on attack messages (*Someone is attacking you!*).
[sphere_msgs.scp] Changed 'stablemaster_*' defmsg to new defs/texts. I HIGHLY recommend update it, since the old 'stablemaster_*' defmsgs won't be used anymore.

27-10-2014, XuN
Attacker.clear can be used now even if character doesn't have a Attacker list, so no error is log in console.

28-10-2014, Coruja
Fixed: Function REGION.REGION.* returning wrong parent region if used on regions which is already the parent region.
Fixed: Function MAKEITEM and some crafting skills always crafting itens using amount=1 instead follow the item replication rule.
[sphere_defs.scp] Added html color defs for BFONT_LRED, BFONT_LYELLOW and BFONT_LCYAN.
[sphere_monsters.scp] Changed human/elf/gargoyle MAXFOOD to 20 (OSI default value).

28-10-2014, XuN
Fixed #2396: Attacking aborted when target is out of range, even if COMBAT_StayInRange is disabled.
Changed Read mode for 'Title', now giving it a parameter will return the 'Trade Title' (Grandmaster Swordsmanship, Journeyman bowcraft, etc) instead of the custom title. (Example of usage: <title 1>).

29-10-2014, XuN
Added can_i_forcedc (sphere_defs.scp), adding this flag to an item will allow it to be DClickable in every situation: from one side of the map to another, or even in another map, weared by another character, or GMs too, no checks at all.
 NOTE: Player's cant DClick what they don't see but they will be able to do it with the LastObject macro, or by knowing the UID and using 3rd party programs, be aware of that.

02-11-2014, XuN
Fixed GetNPCBrain() not working as it should and returning wrong brain (in internal usages) and ignoring the Brain used in CHARDEFS in some cases.
Added Ignore value to Attackers: Setting it to 1 will make the character ignore this target (mostly used by NPCs), when looking for target.
		@CombatAdd has now 2 arguments:
				Argn1 = Initial Threat (If used).
				Argn2 = Setting it to 1 make this enemy to be added as Ignored. (Setting it to 1 for a player in every NPCs will make this player be 'invisible' for them, good to create a faction system and such things).

02-11-2014, XuN, Ben, Feeh (and tons of help from Karma).
Ship's patch:
Added Packet 0xF6 (New Ship's Movement): This packet is affecting ships on client > 7.0.8d (High Seas ones), regardless of the multi files, patched ship's or not patched ones... it's a client's packet.
Added Packet 0xF3 (Packet Container): Used to send tons of items/chars at once in one only packet, used to send items and chars inside multis (Houses and Ships). Clients > 7.0.0 (Stygian Abyss).
Added ShipSpeed and SpeedMode for [Multidef ] definitions:
			ShipSpeed=2,1 (Period,Tiles): Period (in Tenths of second) tell the ship the delay until it moves again, tiles means the tiles moving (Default and suggested is 1, others won't work because of ... (read next line)).
			SpeedMode=(0x01 = one tile, 0x02 = rowboat, 0x03 = slow, 0x04 = fast). This modes have no sense until we have MultiThreading and can change the ticks per sec from 10 to 100 to make ships to move each 0.25seconds (which we cannot now).
Updated multis_ships.scp with these new values.
Fixed ship's planks not working.
Updated the Update and Move (and their related functions) to send the minimal updates required, hence making less rubberband effects.
Fixed some issues with EC and ships making visual strange effects, items staying behind the ship.
Fixed some problems when turning the ships.
Some more minor tweaks related to ships.

NOTE: Mouse Wheel Movement packet is NOT included in this commit.

02-11-2014, Ben

Replaced with LOCAL.SPELL (read only) as ARGN2 was already in use by some of the skill triggers.

09-11-2014, Ben
Fixed #1644: Corpses will now move with ships.

10-11-2014, Coruja
Fixed: SPELLTIMEOUT char property not working correctly.

	-[sphere_msgs.scp]: Updated some 'tracking_*' messages. Also merged all 'skillmenu_text_*' (only used on tracking skillmenu) into 'tracking_*'.
	-[sphere_skills.scp]: Added OSI-like support for ARROWQUESTS on tracking skill (softcoded). OSI uses only the arrow to track (with no messages) but I will leave the old messages as it is for compatibility purposes with old clients.

Changed evelation at which items are considered to be part of a ship. (-2 to +15 from top of deck).

Added: Wisdom racial trait on elves (they always have +20 max mana). It works only if FEATURE_ML_UPDATE is enabled on sphere.ini
Changed: 'Open Bankbox' / 'Check Balance' context menu buttons on NPC Banker (brain_banker) now will make the NPC hear 'bank'/'balance' words instead call hardcoded functions to open bank or check balance. In other words: now both context menu buttons and spoken commands are consistent and can be softcoded.

23-11-2014, Coruja
Added: Tough racial trait on humans (they always have +2 hitpoint regeneration)
Fixed: @GetHit trigger not returning some ARGN2 values (like dam_fixed).
Changed: Updated some damage flags used internally on spells.

Changed: Tooltips now will auto update when item/char properties got changed.

25-12-2014, Ben
Fixed #2447: Again...  Ships not updating characters properly when leaving the screen.

31-12-2014, Ben
Added: "BREAK" function under @create and @npcrestock to return to normal script interpratation after an ITEM= line since any lines under it was designed to modify the item. (any BUY or SELL line will also break ITEM loop)
Changed #2451: Items will now be allowed to be "locked down" to ships and still move with the ship.
Added: new .ADD dialog to replace old add menu. (old menu still available in the scripts by removing d_add dialog, but it is full of errors)

09-01-2015, Ben
Added: Item trigger @Ship_turn with ARGN being the direction the ship is turning. It fires on all items on a ship, including the ship itself.

Added: New optional flag OF_ScaleDamageByDurability on sphere.ini to make weapons/armors lose DAM/AR if the item get damaged. The value is based on current item durability, so the damage can be reverted if the item get repaired.
Fixed: Tooltips not updating when some char properties (criminal/kills/flags/invul) are changed
Fixed: Guards on 'red regions' (regions with TAG.RED=1 set) always using name hue 021 instead ColorNotoEvil set on sphere.ini

[sphere_skills.scp]: Improved ARROWQUEST position on Tracking skill

24-01-2015, Ben
Fixed: Undefined keyword 'ITEM' error when restocking vendors.
Modified: Order of @Create triggers to satify all situations.
	1 - CHARDEF's @Create runs first with @NPCRestock that follows (character does not have a position yet)
	2 - The character is placed in the world (This should fire @Enter in the appropriate region, and unlike before, the character is fully created)
	3 - TEVENTS @Create is fired (character now has a position)
	4 - EVENTSPET @Create is fired

24-01-2015, XuN
Stackable items with different 'new variables' like ResPoison, UsesCur, etc cannot be stacked anymore.
Added MaxAmount variable to stackable items with a default value of 65535 (not using this means no changes). This affect both Itemdefs and already created items (which can differ if you set to).
Droping on self/backpack and bouncing stackable items now makes Sphere trying to reach MaxAmount,
	so if you have one pile of 50k of gold and you drop another 50k you'll end with one stack with 65535 coins and another one with 34465,
	obviously, if you set [itemdef i_gold] to MaxAmount=50000 this will not happen.
Maximum value of MaxAmount keeps being unsigned short, the same, 65535 because of client limitation.
Non stackable items doesn't have MaxAmount


26-01-2015, XuN
Added 'click' function, doesn't need explanation I think.
Setting UsesMax will raise UsesCur too if UsesCur is 0.
Added UsesMax to tools from sphere_item_profession.scp and lumberjacking items (axes/polearms) in sphere_item_provisions_weapons.scp
Using Destroy 1 will make the item emote it's destruction.
Updated Lumberjacking,Fishing and Mining in sphere_skills.scp reflecthing Destroy changes.

27-01-2015, XuN
Updated @CombatDelete trigger with a new argn1 value, now it's telling Sphere to remove or keep 1/0 the attacker's memories when removing him from the list.
Added @HitIgnore trigger firing when one character is going to avoid an ignored target in the target selection: argn1=1 keep him ignored, argn2= un-ignore target (so character can attack him again).
Added @Eat trigger, read wiki for more info: http://wiki.sphere.torfo.org/index.php/@Eat

28-01-2015, Coruja
Added: Support for packet 02c to display char death animation (the famous "You are dead" black screen)
Changed: Min account plevel to bypass MinCharDeleteTime setting on sphere.ini changed from 3 (Seer) to 2 (Counselor)
Changed: return 1 on f_onchar_delete function (sphere_serv_triggers.scp) to deny char exclusion now will show a proper message ("couldn't carry out the request" instead "character is not old enough")

	-Added missing tooltips for Insured (attr_insured), Quest Item (attr_questitem) and Crafted by [CharName] (CRAFTEDBY property)
	-Added weight tooltip on all movable items if FEATURE_ML_UPDATE feature is enabled on sphere.ini (although it's not a ML feature, OSI started using this tooltip only on ML)
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed 'tooltip_tag_amount' text

29-01-2015, Coruja
Changed: Major improvement on combat engine (damage/resist calculations)
	-COMBAT_SPECIALDAMAGE and COMBAT_USE_RESISTANCE settings on sphere.ini are now a single COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE which does the same thing (but now unified).
	-COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE now totally overrides pre-AOS AR calculations with AOS damage/resist types instead use both at the same time.
	-Fixed formula for AR calculation
	-Fixed formula for char damage calculation. If unarmed (wrestling) the base damage will be the char DAM (usually 1-4), and using weapons the base damage will be the weapon damage. This base damage can be increased with some bonuses (if COMBAT_OSIDAMAGEMOD is enabled, it will use OSI bonus calculation, otherwise it will use sphere default bonus [STR/10]).
	-On AOS+ clients, the char status menu now will show exactly the damage range that the char can deal (including all bonuses)
	-New blood effects
	-Old [Physical/Fire/Cold/Poison/Energy]Damage properties got removed and replaced with the new DAM[Physical/Fire/Cold/Poison/Energy].
[Sphere.ini]: Removed COMBAT_TARGETTEDHIT, COMBAT_SPECIALDAMAGE and COMBAT_USE_RESISTANCE settings, and added COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed all "combat_hit_*" messages.

30-01-2015, XuN
Improved how Notoriety is checked for pets with PetsInheritNotoriety flags in the ini, now the notoriety is redirected instantly to pet's owner to avoid some checks and speed up the code. (Nothing has changed, it's just an improvement)
Updated fonts on sphere_item_typedef_equipitem.scp for 'unidentified' value on tooltips.
Splitted stats regens from CChar::OnTick() to CChar::Stats_Regen()
Re-Added old polymorph stats boost under MAGICF_POLYMORPHSTATS (0800) in sphere.ini.
Added MaxPolyStats to ini to override old hardcoded value, this limits the amount of stats gained through polymorph spell (default 150).

30-01-2015, Coruja
Added: 5 new optional arguments on DAMAGE function to make it compatible with COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE feature
	Sintax: DAMAGE value, dam_flag, source, physical(%), fire(%), cold(%), poison(%), energy(%)
	Example: DAMAGE 50,dam_general,012345,70,30,0,0,0 will split 50 damage into 70% physical damage + 30% fire damage
Added: Internal support for COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE on spells, explosion potion, etc
Added: New OSI formula to calculate spell damage if MAGICF_OSIFORMULAS feature is enabled

04-02-2015, Ben
Added: guardcall defname to sphere_def.scp in the [DEFNAME HARDCODED] section to allow an override of the words used to call guards. (multiple words can be defined) 
Fixed #2473: Can't get on other ships from your ship anymore.
Fixed #2467: Orc ship north missing 1 component.

07-02-2015, Ben
Added: Outgoing Packet Filtering using keyword OUTPACKETx=function_name in sphere.ini (works exactly like PACKETx=function_name but for outgoing packets)

13-02-2015, Coruja
Changed: Increased the area radius to call guards [14 -> 18 tiles].
Changed: RESPHYSICAL won't be merged with AR anymore, now both properties can have independent values. Sphere will choose the property to display on client status gump based on COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE setting on sphere.ini (enabled = RESPHYSICAL / disabled = AR).
Added: Weapons and armors now will automatically set DAM*/RES* char properties on equip/unequip.
Fixed: Login internal behavior adding TAG.LastHit=0 on chars even when COMBAT_PREHIT is disabled. This tag is only used by COMBAT_PREHIT, so if it's disabled the tag won't be added anymore.
Fixed #2391: Nearby char names showing wrong notoriety color on client login.

15-02-2015, Coruja
[sphere_defs.scp]: Added missing defs for 'colors_metal' and 'colors_bright'
[sphere_template.scp]: Added missing 'random_talisman' template
[sphere_skills.scp]: Removed USESMAX behavior from Fishing skill (I dont know why, but OSI doesn't seems to use the 'Uses Remaining' behavior on this skill)
[items/*]: Added missing USESMAX property on skill tools items (and removed from i_pole_fishing)
[towns/sphere_town_dlg_master.scp]: Fixed console error [replaced function f_stonesys_iswarring -> f_townsys_iswarring]

	-Updated texts for 'itemuse_rune_name', 'rune_to'
[sphere_skills.scp]:
	-Added missing SKF_RANGED flag on Archery and Throwing skills.
	WARNING: Make sure to update your scripts following this change to prevent some problems on these skills. Previously sphere was internally setting SKF_RANGED on these skills, but now it's 100% on script-side.

Updated sphereCrypt.ini with clients up to 7.0.43.
Added 'stacking' behaviour to NightSight property to allow more than 1 item apply it's value and not removing the nightsight effect when unequipping (this will fix #2475),

Fixed: NPCs (monsters) being flagged criminal when they attack an innocent player.
Changed: Updated minimum client version required to use some new packets.

09-03-2015, Staff_Stanic

Suppose a case that ExperienceKoefPVP=0, players will not gain experience killing npcs, consequently players will not lose experience when killed by npcs.

	CombatBonusStat stores the stat id. STR = 0, INT = 1, DEX = 2
	CombatBonusPercent stores the percentaje of stat applied onto the bonus calculations, value can be negative but total bonus cannot be lower than 1.
[sphere_msgs.scp]
Added these lines:
	//msg_acc_passclear			"Password has been cleared."
	//msg_acc_passclear_relog	"Log out, then back in to set the new password.""

	//target_command				"Select object to set/command '%s'."

21-03-2015, XuN

24-03-2015, XuN
Fixed some code from PacketWheelBoatMove (Move ships with mouse) and enabled it via 'Pilot' variable in ships holding the value of character and one memory item (acting like a horse)
Added few checks for Combat_NoDirChange

Scripts:
 Added t_pilot to sphere_defs.scp
 Updated \items\sphere_item_ship_parts_*.scp adding t_pilot.	//It seems that britannian and orcish ships got their items changed and they look empty now, i did not change this atm.
 Added \Add-On\HighSeas\Ships\HS_Pilot.scp with behaviour for t_pilot and memory item for mouse sailing.
 Added //itemuse_crook_target			"Where do you want them to go ?" to sphere_msgs.scp

26-03-2015, Coruja
Fixed: IDLE clients on login / character selection screen being disconnect on the server-side without display any feedback to client, making it freeze on a infinite 'Connecting...' screen. Now IDLE clients will get an 'timeout' message and will be able to press ok and try again without get stuck.

26-03-2015, XuN
Added 5 more args to .effect function to give support to packet 0c7, new values are: EffectID,ExplodeID,SoundID,UID,Type. Seems to work only on EC.
Added Bonded property for npcs with very basic functionality, setting it to 1 doesn't let NPCs die.
Removed some debug msgs.
Changed some more m_Act_Targ to m_Fight_Targ.
Corpses retrieve killer's uid now from Attacker_GetLast() instead of on ACT.

27-03-2015, XuN
Changed DClick of t_ship_plank using SetDispID() instead of SetID() so they are threated as ship parts and 'fliped' with the rest of the ship.
Changed the 'Undefined symbol '' ' output format, now also prints what was the problem exactly in some situations. IE: if (<local.hello==1) // missing '>' will print 21:15:ERROR:(s_add.scp,21)Undefined symbol '' ['<local.hello==)']
[sphere_spells.scp]: Added missing '>' to local.damagetype in s_explosion.
Added another block of code for @SeeCrime, now it fires also when a 3rd part sees a crime (I'm seeing Player X attacking Player Y while Y is 'good'), to decide if mark as 'bad guy' the aggresor for this character.
	argn1 = attacker
	argn2 = victim
	argn3 = 1=criminal / 0='turn eyes away'
Fighting Memory will also remove flag MEMORY_AGGREIVED when expiring (NEED feedback on this) to avoid blue-innocent player becoming criminal when the fight memory of the attacker expires (if he attacked back).
Being attacked is not giving MEMORY_AGGREIVED to memory item, I might be attacked but it may not have to do anything with me being aggreived ... they may have been attacked by me first (Need feedback on this too).

28-03-2015, XuN
[sphere_defs.scp]:
	Added Expansion definitions.
	Added t_rope
[items/sphere_item_unsorted]:
	Added t_rope to i_rope
[multis_ships.scp]:
	Changed Height from all Tokuno ships from 7 to 17.
	Added Expansion=EXPANSION_HS to all HS ships.
[add-on/HighSeas/Ships/HS_pilot.scp]:
	Added mount check to t_pilot to prevent the memory item being bounced to pack.

Added t_rope working like t_ship_plank but making no changes on ID, by default it doesn't have any 'I'm in ship' checks when steping them for two reasons, ropes should be in ships and this way they can be used in houses to go out?
Added <TEXTF > function returning formatted text, example:
	[defname exampledef]
	test=Hello %s, I'll teach you for %d coins.
	message=<textf "<def.test>",<src.name>,15> // Quotes are A MUST.

29-03-2015, XuN
Fixed humans not regenerating hitpoints
Changed Stats Regens to automatically update the timer of next tick instead of waiting for old value when changing it via RegenHits/Stam/Mana.

31-03-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Arch Protection spell not working correctly with COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE enabled.
Fixed: Resurrection spell not displaying correct EFFECT_ID / SOUND.
Added: MAGICF_OSIFORMULAS behavior on more spells.
Changed: Small improvements on drunkness effect (ale, wine, liquor).
[sphere.ini]: Moved EF_PetSlots setting (experimental flag) to OF_PetSlots (optional flag).
[sphere_admin.scp]: Added missing 'admin_resdisp_8' def.
[sphere_msgs.scp]:
	-Changed IMSG_DEF_UNICODE to 1 (to match internal client behavior, which always show item/char names using unicode by default).
	-Removed useless 'spell_alcohol_sober' msg.

01-04-2015, matex
Fixed: SYSCMD never could return an exit value and was hanging sometimes.

01-04-2015, XuN
Fixed NPCs not moving to current fight target.
Added scripts/items/sphere_item_provisions_logs.scp with different log types.
Changed scripts/items/sphere_item_provisions.scp: Moved i_log(s) / i_board(s) to scripts/items/sphere_item_provisions_logs.scp

01-04-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Buff/Debuff spells not working correctly when MAGICF_OSIFORMULAS is disabled.
[sphere_item_provisions_logs.scp]: Fixed some boards using wrong itemdef.

02-04-2015, XuN
Added Repair function (Called on Repareid item, must be called with a character as SRC, who is going to perform the repair action).
Added Smelt function ( called on Smelted item, must be called with a character as SRC. ARGS=forge or another ore pile to smelt, if no ARGS is given it will search automatically for nearest forge if any ).
Changed @StatGain trigger is not being fired anymore with any stat changes from the @Create trigger.
Fixed local.CreateObject1 & 2 in @Success trigger for field spells causing the new items to do not use the same placement checks as default items.
Updated behaviour of Bonded Pets ONLY when they are DEAD:
	-They act as normal for everything, excepting they cannot die.
	-Follow any master's command, excepting fighting ones.
	-Doesn't regenerate stats.
	-NPCs won't die if they have bonded=1, if they are dead already and bonded is set to 0 they will die in next ticks.
	-Stam required to step over them is 0.
	-Food doesn't decay.
Fixed: Pets following when recalling/teleporting/gate travelling should be more consistent.
Changed: Mounted items calls now CChar::OnTick() on the mounted character instead of doing the tick on it's own, so they regenerate stats and everything like any other character in a more realistic way.
Fixed STATSUM and STAT_STR/DEX/INT from SkillClasses not being readed correctly (or at all) in some cases, this should permanently stop the need of custom statcaps. This is how StatGain works today (** = what was fixed):
	-Only INT can be gained when Polymorphed.
	-Stats with any StatLock different than UP can't increase.
	-StatCap <= StatSum stops the execution. **
	-STAT_* > STAT_VALUE from SkillClass = ignore this stat **
	-STAT_* > STAT_VALUE for this Stat in the performed Skill = ignore this stat.
	-Then the checks for %chances are made.
[sphere_msgs.scp]:
	Added //msg_bonded_dead_cantmount			"The creature is dead and cannot be mounted."

03-04-2015, Coruja
Fixed: EXP/LEVEL going < 0 on chars when the property value is changed by scripts using @ExpChange / @ExpLevelChange triggers.
Fixed: CUSTOMIZE function not hiding correctly all dynamic items on multi when entering on customization mode.

06-04-2015, Coruja
Fixed: NPC Guards (brain_guard) incorrectly teaching skills to players.
Fixed: Protection spell not returning the Magic Resistance skill to correct value if this skill was set to lock/down on the skill menu (when COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE is enabled).
Fixed: Mana Drain, Wall of Stone and Energy Vortex spells using wrong EFFECT / DURATION if MAGICF_OSIFORMULAS is enabled.

08-04-2015, XuN
Changes in @Effect/@SpellEffect triggers for spells:
	Local.CreateObject1 overrides the effect id.
	Added Local.EffectColor, local.EffectRender and local.EffectExplode allowing to override the values of the sent effect.

Added Local.EffectColor to @Success/@SpellSuccess to change the color of field spells.

Reordered how effects are called (now they are all together inside SpellEffect()) to have better access to them.
Removed some Effect() calls to prevent two effects being sent in some spells.
Removed Effect_Bolt(), its now handled by SPELLFLAG_FX_BOLT inside SpellEffect().
*Any of this changes are affecting lightning spells, since client ignores everything related to lightnings (.effect 1,1).

Changed @SpellCast / @Start trigger for characters / spells:
	- Added local.WOP=0/1 to disable/enable WOP for this character / spell.
	- Added local.WOPColor (default = SERV.WOPColor) to change Word of Power's color for this character / spell .
	- Added local.WOPFont (default = SERV.WOPFont) to change WOP's font for this character / spell .

11-04-2015, Coruja

11-04-2015, XuN
Added char* definitions for both ContextMenuRequest and ContextMenuSelect (@charContextMenuSelect/Request).
Fixed NewGold not calling @Create if any new pile was created.
Fixed NewGold not taking care of MaxAmount.

15-04-2015, XuN
Added to sphere_msgs.scp:	(emotes for poison seems to have different values for poisoned character and the other ones)
for poisoned characters:
	//spell_osipoison_lesser		"feel a bit nauseous"
	//spell_osipoison_standard		"feel disorientated and nauseous!"
	//spell_osipoison_greater		"begin to feel pain throughout your body!"
	//spell_osipoison_deadly		"feel extremely weak and are in severe pain!"
	//spell_osipoison_lethal		"are in extreme pain, and require immediate aid!"
for viewers:
	//spell_osipoison_lesser1		"looks ill."
	//spell_osipoison_standard1		"looks extremely ill."
	//spell_osipoison_greater1		"stumbles around in confusion and pain."
	//spell_osipoison_deadly1		"is wracked with extreme pain."
	//spell_osipoison_lethal1		"begins to spasm uncontrollably."

CHANGED Poison function:
	By default it accepts 1 parameter (skill level)
	It can now have a second parameter for duration ticks (If not given, ticks are calculated as always = SkillLevel /50 ).

Added new behaviour for poison spell under MAGIFC_OSIFORMULAS:
	Poison Level = (Magery + Poisoning) /2:	(Stored in MoreY)
		Lesser (0):		Level <= 65.0
		Standard (1):	Level <= 85.0
		Greater (2):	Level < 100.0
		Deadly (3):		Level > 100.0
	Poison can be Lethal also with a 10% chances if the magery and poisoning of the poisoner are greather than 100.0 and distance < 3 tiles.
	Tick Period: 
		Lesser =		2 seconds.
		Standard =		3 seconds.
		Greater =		4 seconds
		Deadly/Lethal = 5 seconds.
	Duration:(More2) (if poison spell is called from POISON function, this values will be applied only if argn2 == 0, if set to another value then the given value will be used)
		Lesser =		30 seconds.
		Standard =		30 seconds.
		Greather =		60 seconds.
		Deadly =		60 seconds.
		Lethal =		80 seconds.
	Damage:(Currently values for poisons > Lesser are calculated on SpellEffect (MoreZ), so the same damage is dealed in each tick, AFAIK this is how it works)
		Lesser =		4-7% current hp.
		Standard =		5-10% max hp.
		Greater =		7-15% max hp.
		Deadly =		15-30% max hp.
		Lethal =		16-33% max hp

Added new ini flag COMBAT_NOPOISONHIT :Disables old (55i like) poisoning style: Poisoning > 30.0 && (RAND(100.0)> Poisoning) for monsters OR weapon.morez && (RAND(100) < weapon.morez ) for poisoned weapons.
INFORMATION: These have been unchanged, i'm writing here however for information of how is the poison's strenght calculated.
	Poison applied using weapon: src.poison <eval <weapon.morez>*10>,<eval <weapon.morez>/5> (so morez*10 = poison damage and morez/5 = ticks)
	Poison applied by monsters: src.poison <eval <r<Poisoning>>>, <r<eval <Poisoning>/50>>	(so strength is a rand of the poisoning skill and ticks are poisoning skill / 50
	Poisoned food has not been altered either, but here is the formula too: src.poison <eval <morez>*10>,1+<eval <morez>/50> (so the food's morez*10 is the strenght and ticks = morez /50 too).

15-04-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Some skills only rising until 30.0% on specific situations.
Changed: Some small changes on Magic Reflection spell.

27-04-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Guilds not display notoriety correctly on players with recruit access level.
Fixed: Magic Reflection effect only working on spells with SPELLFLAG_RESIST set. Now only spells with direct target (SPELLFLAG_TARG_CHAR) can be reflected.
Fixed: Spells with SPELLFLAG_HARM flag not flagging the caster criminal when it got resisted/reflected by the target.
Changed: Some improvements on Magic Resistance (skill) effect.
[Sphere.ini]: Added new ColorNotoInvulGameMaster setting to tweak the name notoriety color on invul Game Master chars (purple by default).
[sphere_spells.scp]:
	-Added missing DURATION on Mana Drain spell.
	-Updated SPELLFLAG_RESIST / SPELLFLAG_TARG_NOSELF on some spells.

28-04-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Mounts not creating the corpse when it die while ridden.

02-05-2015, XuN
REMOVED tag.override.noto completely now, @NotoSend was made as an enhanced version of this tag.
Added: argn2 in @NotoSend trigger forcing the character's packet to use this value as character's color but not modifying the real notoriety.
Changed: @NotoSend argn1 value now only can have values between 1 (NOTO_GOOD) and 7 (NOTO_INVUL) if other value is given it will be ignored and default checks will be made, color will still be used (if value >= 0)
Updated http://wiki.sphere.torfo.org/index.php/@NotoSend information.

Fixed some cases in which victims of a crime (attacked characters) became criminals. Also, but not always related to the same scenario, Notoriety not checking flags for MEMORY_HARMEDBY, which was causing the 'criminal issue' and also a bunch of unnecessary checks.
Fixed Guards being able to be flagged as criminals and doing the whole checks: Guards always acts for the law and they will never be criminal (this has been this way always but checks were performed anyway).
All of this fixed too @SeeCrime from combat not always working.
CHANGED: Old @SeeCrime is now @SeeSnoop http://wiki.sphere.torfo.org/index.php/@SeeSnoop
ADDED: New @SeeCrime trigger for every crime unrelated to Snooping: http://wiki.sphere.torfo.org/index.php/@SeeCrime
Updated: http://wiki.sphere.torfo.org/index.php/Override_TAGs

Removed 'glow effect' from parrying in the source and added it under @UseQuick in parrying skill in sphere_skills.scp
Fixed @Eat not setting values correctly in some cases.
Fixed argn2 on @NotoSend not working as intended (notice that PetsInheritNotoriety may affect and block this).

07-05-2015, XuN
Updated sphere_serv_triggers.scp with some information/comments and values for newly created characters.
Added Notoriety values changed via @NotoSend to be sent in character's names: 
	-argn2 has priority over anything else, if it's value is 0, lesser or not present at all then argn1 will be used, if there's no argn1 either then default checks will be made.
	-argn2 values from 1 to 7 will read color hues from ini ones (NOTO_GOOD,NOTO_CRIMINAL...NOTO_INVUL,etc).
Poison spell and habilities based on it are now affected by SPELLFLAG_NoUnparalyze (if set).
Fixed some errors appearing when a character dies while poisoned conflicting with PacketDeathAnimation.
Poison damage has now DAM_MAGIC flag set.
Uncommented EFFECT value for Poison spell in sphere_spells.scp

08-05-2015, Coruja
Added: New 'Add/Remove Party Member' missing popup button when click on another player to invite/remove him from an party.
Changed: Some updates/optimizations on party engine.
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Updated 'party_*' messages.
[sphere_defs.scp]: Added missing 'attr_opened' value on [DEFNAME attr_flags] list.

09-05-2015, XuN
Fixed: Ignored 'attackers' will not be chosen as targets anymore, even if they are the only enemies on the list.
Added: Field spells will fire @Create for their itemdefs/events, also @ItemCreate for characters with a 'tag.BadLoc' which will be true if they are going to be placed above any character.
	If tag keeps at 1 after the @Create trigger the field will be removed like it's been doing recently.
	Since fields will not be placed until they are allowed to (to avoid 'ghost' walls dissapearing), items will have a 'tag.pos' with the placement position.

09-05-2015, Coruja
Added: New updated Swing Speed combat formula. It's almost the same as the previous formula (pre-AOS) but more accurate and with support to Swing Speed Increase property (INCREASESWINGSPEED).
[sphere.ini]: Updated 'SpeedScaleFactor' setting to the recommended value for the new Swing Speed formula [15000 -> 80000]. Although the old (or any other value) can be used, it's HIGHLY recommended update it to get better results.
[npcs/sphere_monsters.scp]: Added MAXFOLLOWER, RESPHYSICALMAX, RESFIREMAX, RESCOLDMAX, RESPOISONMAX, RESENERGYMAX properties on playable chars (c_man, c_woman, c_elf_male, c_elf_female, c_gargoyle_male, c_gargoyle_female).
[sphere_serv_triggers.scp]: Removed RES*MAX from f_onchar_create (it was moved directly to chardefs).

10-05-2015, Ben
Added: ABS() intrinsic function wich returns the absolute of any number ( <eval abs(5)> = 5, <eval abs(-5)> = 5 )

13-05-2015, XuN
Receiving 0 damage will not generate blood anymore.
Improved the code for 'Attacker'.

Updated/improved/cleaned Spells:

-Added internal definitions for all spells
-Added support for spells with id 1000 to 1055 for custom spells and other old spells, reflected changes in sphere_spells.scp*
-t_spellbook_extra works with values 1000+
-Changed NPCs formulas to make them able to cast spells from other books than MAGERY one, selected from skills with SKF_MAGIC**:
-Fixed the formula to select the maximum spell NPCs can cast because any npc with magery > 10.0 could cast all spells, now maxspell is calculated like this (using magery as example) :
	maxspell = MULDIV(Skill_GetValue(magery),Spells_GetMax(magery),Skill_GetMax(magery)). To get a real progression for skill's capabilities this adjusts automatically to each skill's max spells, so 78.2 necromancy will let npcs cast up to spell 12 and 71.4 magery will let npc cast up to spell 37 for example.
		Skill_GetValue() returns the current value for this skill,
		Spells_GetMax() returns the total amount of spells for this skill (64 for magery, 17 for necromancy...),
		SkillGetMax() returns the maximum amount of this skill (Based on skillclass for players and 100.0 (or tag.override.skillcap_&skill if present) for NPCs)
-NOTE: This has not been changed, and it's ONLY for magery as it was before (since other skills was not being checked): spells are selected in a FOR loop so, for magery and to avoid big loops each time a spell must be selected, first spell being checked is <r<maxspell>>. So if maxspell = 50 it will choose spells between <r50> and 50.

[sphere_defs.scp]:
	-added spellflag_heal             040000000  // spell used to heal hitpoints or resurrect
	-added LAYER_* definitions for all spells that need a layer item to handle their behaviour (behaviours not added).
*[sphere_spells.scp]: 
	-Changed ID for spell number 64 to 1000 and so on with the next ones until spell 99.
	-Added spellflag_heal to s_heal,s_greater_heal,s_close_wounds,s_noble_sacrifice,s_gift_of_life,
	-Added flags to Spellweaving spells.
**[sphere_skills]: Added SKF_MAGIC to MAGERY,NECROMANCY,SPELLWEAVING,MYSTICISM and CHIVALRY
-Added NPC_AI setting: 
	// NPC_AI_STRICTCAST		01000	NPC's will only select spells they really have in their spellbook. Old behaviour let them to select any spell with SPELLFLAG_HARM if they have magery enough to cast it regardless of spellbook.
FIXED i_spellbook_spellweaving was MOREZ=0600, it should be 600
FIXED argn2 for @SpellSelect couldn't be overriden for spells casted from T_WAND or T_SCROLL. ARGN2 is also set to the proper mana value (0 for T_WAND and RequiredMana /2 for I_SCROLL) for reading purposes.
Updated comment for t_spellbook_extra       186   // some spellbook for script purposes (MOREZ=basic offset, should 1000 or more) in sphere_defs.scp
	Added morex for t_spellbook_extra to set the max amount of spells for this book, so morez = first spell and morex = last spell , for example morey=1000, morez=1016 will hold spells from 1000 to 1016

Added spellflag_poly on sphere_spells.scp, also added support on the source to make them working: 
	-Lich Form
	-Wraith Form
	-Horrific Beast
	-Vampiric Embrace
	-Stone Form
	-Reaper Form
Added some code for s_healing_stone and i_healing_stone in both sphere_spells.scp and sphere_item_magic_mysticism.scp


16-05-2015, Ben
Fixed #2510: deathshroud not removing on resurrection in all cases.

17-05-2015, XuN
Updated @NPCActFight:
	Added - local.skill // Setting this to any skill will make the NPC begin this skill
	Added - local.spell // For magic skills this will be the casted spell
	Added - ACT // This will refer to the target, must be set since the trigger is using SRC for the first enemy
	Added - return 2 // The code above will only work when return = 2
Removed NPC_AI_STRICTCAST and all the invented casts from npcs.This can be reverted applying a trigger for npcs like this:
	ON=@NPCActFight
	if (<magery> > 0)
		local.spell=<r1,64>
		while (<local.spell> < 64)
			if (<CanCast <local.spell>>)
				local.skill=magery
				return 2
			else
				local.spell ++
			endif
		endwhile
	endif	//same for the other magic skills.

Added vector list storing all spells that npcs can cast and removed tons of lines of code to increase the performance of CPU when NPCs cast some spells.
WARNING:
	Added LAYER variable to spells, ALL SPHERE_SPELLS.SCP MUST BE UPDATED or spells with some effect, like polymorphs, summons, stat spells, and all that have a determinated duration will stop working
	[sphere_spells.scp]	//Seriously, this script must be updated.
		-Added LAYER=layer_spell_* to all magery, necromancy, spellweaving,chivalry and mysticism spells, ie LAYER=layer_spell_stats for s_bless,s_cunning, etc
Changed default formulas to make spells work with LAYER instead of hardcoded checks, this will help making custom spells by giving the customization enough to handle every possible effect.

Changed: MemoryEquip won't be called anymore for the memories of spell's effects.
Added character trigger @EffectAdd: This will be called when any type of effect memory is being added, like stat changes for s_bless, s_cunning... s_weaken ...
	Argo = memory item
	argn1 = spellid
returns: 
	return 0: Let default checks to happen.
	return 1: Blocks any action and stops everything, also deletes the memory (Blocking any changes, this will cause also the effect to do not have duration)
	return 2: Let the memory exist but block default checks, perfect to override default effects and do some custom stuff.
To simulate something like '@EffectEnd' just apply an event with @Timer to the memory since the 'default changes' are happening after @UnEquip and, at this point, the item must be removed in any case... so preventing this must be done before (@Timer fits perfectly).

19-05-2015, Coruja
Added: New animation on dragon breath attack.
Changed: Reduced SAY/speech max text length (1024 -> 256 chars). Client is limited to 128 chars on default speech and 256 chars on journal, so this can avoid some exploits from 3rd party assists/tools without affect the gameplay.
Changed: Major optimizations on walk, skills and general ticks code. It's working fine, but needs some heavy testing until we mark it as 100% stable.
	-IMPORTANT: Be sure to update your sphere_skills.scp with proper FLAGS on all fight/ranged/magic/craft/gather skills, otherwise these skills will not work correctly.

20-05-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Parrying skill check always returning 'true' (success) on chars with GM=1 set, making the char never receive any damage on combat even without invul flag set.
Changed: Improved Teleport/Dispel spell smoke animation.
Changed: Another huge optimization on skills code.
[Sphere.ini]: Updated TeleportEffectNPC / TeleportEffectPlayers settings with correct values.

22-05-2015, Coruja
Fixed: NPCs not following his owner/target correctly.
Changed: Some improvements on pet follower slots and pet bonding engine.
[sphere_defs.scp]: Added missing 't_healing_stone' on [TYPEDEFS] section.

22-05-2015, XuN
Major updates on code to fix compiler LVL4 warnings.
Changed sector's size for map 4 from 8 to 16  (so we only have 5k sectors on this map instead of 31k), improving heavily performance when this map is enabled.
NOTE: Disabling unused maps / using the less possible will increase the performance exponentially since each tick a loop for all maps and all it's sectors is fire, take this in count.

28-05-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Spell buff/debuff icons showing wrong info on client login.
[maps/sphere_map3.scp]: Added missing AREADEF a_isle_of_divide
[maps/sphere_map4.scp]: Updated header comments
[sphere_defs.scp]: Updated some cliloc values on 'buff_clilocs'
[sphere_spells.scp]: Fixed Dispel Field spell flags [spellflag_targ_obj -> spellflag_targ_item]

29-05-2015, Coruja
Some minor design updates on SphereSvr.exe file/console.

30-05-2015, XuN
Added: TAG.SeenBy_uid for items with attr_invis allow these items to be seen by characters with the given uid, ie: tag.SeenBy_015af=1 will allow player with uid 015af to see this item, usefull for traps/quest items/etc.

Changed return 2 from EffectAdd to return 0 to avoid some problems.
Added only if FEATURE_AOS_B is enabled:
	- Behaviour for HitLeechMana on weapons: Returned mana = 0 - X. Where X is the HitLeechMana% of (Damage dealt * 0.4). More info in: http://www.uoguide.com/Hit_Mana_Leech
	- Behaviour for HitLeechLife on weapons: On every successful hit you will leech 0 to X percent health of (Damage done * 0.3) where X is the Hit Life Leech value on your weapon. (This means the same as HitLeechMana but using *0.3 instead of *0.4)
	- Behaviour for HitManaDrain on weapons: %of draining a 20% of the damage dealt from the enemy's mana. so HitManaDrain = 50 means a 50% of draining mana to the target. Mana drained = 20% of the damage done.
	- Behaviour for EnhancePotions on characters: Effect of the potion is increased by the % set on this property.
Added default behaviours for the following necromancy spells (some of them was already working but not with their full effects):
	s_curse_weapon = Adds +x HitLeechLife to any equipped weapon, while the spell is in effect unequiped weapons will get this bonus removed and equipped weapons will gain the bonus. X is stored at memory's morey (50 by default).
	s_blood_oath = When a target of s_blood_oath damages the caster... the damage amount is increased, the target also receives the x% of damage than the caster. X by default should be 100, but its lowered to this formula: ((Resisting Spells Skill x 10) / 20) + 10. X is stored at memory's morey.
	s_corpse_skin = Turns the victim's skin dry and corpse like. This temporarily decreases the target's fire and poison resists (Fire and Poison resist decreased by 15 (more1h) each), while increasing resistance to cold and physical damage (increasing both by 10 (more1L) each).
	s_evil_omen = http://www.uoguide.com/Evil_Omen
	s_pain_spike = http://www.uoguide.com/Pain_Spike
	s_wraith_form = Gets + 15 Resphysical (more1h) and -5(more1l) ResEnergy/ResFire while the effect is active, it also grants the same effect (but not working with it's property) as HitLeechMana returning a % of the target's mana calculated from = Spirit Speak / 50 (24% at 120.0 Spirit Speak), also grants the ability to walk through creatures and players in Felucca
	s_mind_rot = Decreases the LowerManaCost property on the character.
	s_horrific_beast = Provides a bonus of unarmed damage (stored in more1l & more1h on the spell's memory, default = 5,9), Gains a +20 RegenHitsVal (more2) and +25 Melee damage increase (morey). It's also unable to cast other spells than polymorphing ones (@SpellCast in c_horrific_beast).
	s_poison_strike	= scripted.
	s_wither = scripted.
	s_strangle = Info here: http://www.uoguide.com/Strangle
	s_lich_form = +13 RegenValMana (more1l), -5 RegenValHits (more1h), -10 ResFire and +10 ResPoison/ResCold ( all three stored in more2).
	s_vampiric_embrace = +20% HitLeechLife (more1l), +15 RegenStamVal (more1h), +3 RegenManaVal (more2), -25 ResFire (morey).

NOTES:
	- Almost all graphical effects for these spells are still not applied yet. Same for RUNE_ITEMs.
	- Polymorphs from Necromancy have an increased damage received from Undead Slayer Weapons, since there's no hardcoded support for Slayer Weapons (yet?) I didn't add it. Feel free to script it.
	- These Spells may not be working at 100% yet, just sent 'initial' code. sphere_spells.scp MUST be updated.
	- Some behaviours related to spells and props are going to change in the following days.
	
[sphere_defs.scp]
	- Added LAYER_Spell_BLood_Oath and modified the following values to match it's order.
[sphere_spells.scp]
	-Changed LAYER for s_strangle to LAYER_Spell_Strangle
	-Behaviour for s_wither
	-Behaviour for s_poison_strike
	-Flags, RUNE_ITEM and more values for spells 100+.
	-Added code under @Select for all spellflag_polymorph spells to unpolymorph who is already polymorphed (same as s_polymorph).
[sphere_monsters.scp]
	-Added: c_horrific_beast -> ON=@SpellCast trigger avoiding any casts for this creature if a player is morphed on it.
[sphere_item_deco_signs.scp] (Darksun)
	-Added missing definitions for all signs.
[sphere_item_magic_necromancer_aos.scp]
	-Added fake runes for all necromancy spells, they don't have real entries in tiledata but i'm using custom itemdefs with their scrolls as baseid.

Taking in count lot of recent changes realized that some properties must properly shown or hidden according to some ini flags, so ResFire,ResPhysical, etc will only be shown on item's ToolTips if COMBAT_ELEMENTAL_ENGINE is enabled

31-05-2015, Coruja
Changed: Some small code improvements on HITLEECH[LIFE/MANA/STAM] properties.
Changed: Messsage 'Expansion maps supported' on server startup now will show the real map name (Felucca, Ilshenar, Malas, ...) instead UO expansion name (T2A, LBR, AOS, ...)
[Sphere.ini]: Changed all MAPx settings to use -1 as sector size. This will make sphere use the default sector size value (64x64) instead .ini value (32x32).

01-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: ABS() intrinsic function not working correctly.
Changed: Some small improvements on AddContextMenuEntry function.

02-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Console error when players die.
Fixed: PacketDeathAnimation .ini setting not working correctly.
Changed: Some improvements on 'death' / 'make corpse' internal code. Now any NPC will have corpse when it die (unless it was an summoned NPC). So don't get confused if you see corpses of some NPCs which previously doesn't have corpse (elementals, etc), it's the default OSI behavior. Also TAG.DEATHFLAGS can be used to force removal/creation of the corpse on @Death.

03-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: Paralyze spell formula (AOS -> pre-AOS) when MAGICF_OSIFORMULAS is enabled.
Added: Functionality for BONUS[STR/DEX/INT], BONUS[HITS/STAM/MANA] and LOWERMANACOST properties.

04-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Damages not removing Paralyze effect.
Fixed: Console error when casting spells that have effect duration.
Changed: Some improvements on Blood Oath and Evil Omen spells (necromancy).

06-06-2015, XuN
Added some missing casts
Fixed DEBUG errors when entering/leaving RED areas.
Reverted back m_uidKiller in m_itCorpse to CGrayUIDBase to fix build not compiling.

06-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Field spells and triggers @Step (items) / @ItemStep (chars) not working correctly.

08-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Function AddContextEntry not working correctly on HS clients >= 7.0.0.0
Fixed: Dead bonded pets not updating the ghost corpse correctly on resurrect.
Fixed: Explosion potions causing damage to nearby items when it explodes.

10-06-2015, Coruja
Added: Player corpses now will turn into bones when it got carved or before it decay. Also improved the corpse carving behavior, and now when the corpse got carved it will place all items inside the bone container instead drop everything on the ground.
Fixed: Wrong message appearing when the char get flagged criminal (changed 'msg_criminal' to 'msg_guards').
Fixed: Poison/Paralyze Field spells continuously hitting the player at every second instead just hit when needed.
Fixed: Console error when an NPC cast Nightsight spell or use Meditation skill.
Changed: Invulnerable chars (FLAGS=statf_invul) now are able to attack another char instead get the attack "magically blocked".
[sphere_item_deco_dungeons_traps_dead.scp]: Removed TYPE=t_meat_raw, TDATA1 and VALUE from all 'i_flesh_*' items (they aren't foot and nor sellable items).
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Updated all 'carve_corpse_*' messages and removed 'msg_criminal', 'msg_magic_block'.
[sphere_spells.scp]: Added missing 'spellflag_tard_dead' on s_resurrection spell.
	-IMPORTANT: It's HIGHLY recommended update it, or Resurrection spell will stop working.

10-06-2015, XuN
Fixed: Res* not reducing damage anymore
Fixed: Having RegenHits/Mana/Val greater than ini's setting stoping the regen process forever for this character.

11-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: Some small improvements on explosion potion effect.
Fixed: Console error "Hair/Beard not in a corpse" when corpse bones got saved on worldsave.

12-06-2015, XuN
Changed all TAG.TamingSlots entries to FollowerSlots in: sphere_monsters.scp, sphere_monsters_custom.scp and spherechar_evil.scp.
Added @FollowersUpdate trigger called in any update of followers related to OF_PetSlots:
	argn1 (R/W): 0 = Adding followers (taming, unshrinking, summoning, buying ...), 1 = sustracting followers (release, transfer ...)
	argn2 (R/W): FollowerSlots used.
	SRC: Pet causing the trigger to run, when buying in vendors there's no PET yet, so SRC will point to the vendor.
	Return 1 will not allow following actions to occur: Transfer, Summon, UnShrinks from t_figurine, Buy from vendors. Any other actions (like release, set owner...) will not take in count returns.

13-06-2015, XuN
Fixed #2515: Added local.sound to @Effect and @SpellEffect triggers, by default it uses spell->sound excepting effects from potions which will have a random value between 0x030 and 0x031 (old value), this is writable, 0 means no sound.
Fixed #2517: Added BREATH.TYPE to Breath's animation, this will tell Sphere what type of effect to use (same types as .effect).
	- To help keeping old behaviour (explosion on target instead of following fireball) I added BREATH.ANIM and BREATH.TYPE to every brain_dragon in sphere_monsters.scp and sphere_monsters_custom.scp, just remove the // on these lines with a quick find&replace to enable old style breath.

14-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Summoned NPCs incorrectly creating corpses on death.
Fixed: Summoned mounts not disappearing on summon timer expiration if it was mounted.
Fixed: Region flags REGION_ANTIMAGIC_RECALL_IN and REGION_ANTIMAGIC_TELEPORT incorrectly blocking Resurrection spell effect.
Fixed: Client screen not being updated correctly when ghosts got resurrected.
Fixed: Possible console error when players/NPCs try pick/drop some specific items.
Fixed: Combat not flagging the attacker criminal if the attack was parried by the target.

16-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: Some optimizations on internal walk code and spell add/remove behavior.
Fixed: Paralyze effect not updating the client immediatelly when it goes off, making the client only able to walk after ~100ms on next tick update.
Fixed: Function SERV.MAP(x,y,z,m) returning console error instead '0' when 'm' is a invalid/disabled map.
[Sphere.ini]: Added new ItemsMaxAmount .ini setting. This will globally set max allowed amount for all stackable items (default is 60000).
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed 'msg_invisible' and 'msg_tingling' messages.

17-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Stamina not decreasing correctly when walk over another char.
Fixed: Packet to update char hitpoints being sent twice to nearby party members.
Fixed: Properties like STR/ModSTR/MaxHits/etc making the char have current status value > max allowed value when the status got lowered.

18-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: Combat now will make blood effects only for physical damage (wrestling / weapons).
Changed: Field spells casted over the same field already created on ground now will make the previous field tile got replaced with the new one.
Changed: Trigger @DropOn_Ground / @ItemDropOn_Ground now is fired when the item is already on the ground instead get fired before place it on ground. So there's no more ARGS showing the drop location P (use <ACT.P> instead) and also 'return 1' will disable drop sound and decay timer.
Fixed: ATTR 'attr_magic' and 'attr_newbie' incorrectly affecting the item decay timer when it got dropped on ground.
[Sphere.ini]: Updated ClientLinger setting with correct value.

19-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: NEWNPC function won't automatically place the created NPC on source P anymore. Like NEWITEM, the NPC will be created virtually and must be placed on the world using P=x,y. This will prevent the server send unnecessary/duplicated 'update' packets to clients.
Fixed #2514: Hiding / Stealth skills and Poison / Poison Field spells not updating the client screen correctly on action success.
Fixed #2518: Mounts losing bonded status on dismount.

21-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: Improved stamina checks when walking.
Fixed: Possible console error on specific char actions like walk, teleport and cast spells.

23-06-2015, Coruja
Changed: Some internal improvements on explosion potions code.
Changed: Items dropped on invalid location on ground now will get bounced to char backpack instead get moved to char P.
Fixed: Items being able to be dropped on ground inside walls tiles.
Fixed: Possible console error when casting field spells.
Fixed: CUSTOMIZE function on customizable multis not hiding correctly all house dynamic items on ground when client enter on customization mode.
Fixed: House customization menu making the char get moved to multi center when it switch to another floor level.

23-06-2015, matex
Changed: Disabled assertions in non-debug Linux builds. This should not be necessary anymore because there is a SIGSEGV handler in linux builds.
Added: Experimental feature for Sectorsleeping which can be enabled during compilation by using _SECTOR_INTTICK. 
It basically checks in a 3x3 matrix around each sector if there are any players around to determine if the sector is sleeping. 
This leads to a more intelligent distribution of available compute power on small maps (because then the Sectorsleepmask can be 
increased without any immediately 'noticeable' effects). It is not yet available in nightly builds because I consider it too performance 
critical to make it available via a Sphere.ini setting (this would induce an additional comparison in each tick.)

24-06-2015, XuN
Added TithingUse variable for [SPELL ] working like ManaUse but for Tithing Points.
Fixed #2521: delay reseting after the the trigger, so it was impossible to change it.
Added support for Tithing in spells, note that LowerManaCost doesn't affect Tithing points but LowerReagentsCost does it unlike for mana.
Fixed a typo causing humans to create 10% of t_hide when carving corpses instead of applying a bonus of 10%
sphere_msgs.scp: Added //spell_try_notithing			"You must have at least %s Tithing Points to use this ability"	//1060173
sphere_item_provisions_armor.scp: Updated Description and Subsection for gargoyle leather armor.
sphere_spells.scp: Added TithingUse to chivalry spells.

25-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Walking over ghosts requiring stamina to pass.
Fixed: Mounts disappearing on worldsave on some specific situations.
Added: New REFUSETRADES (bool 0/1) char property. If set to true (1), it will prevent others clients to open secure trades with this char.
Added: New 'Allow Trades' / 'Refuse Trades' context menu buttons to toggle REFUSETRADES property. Unfortunately only clients >= 7.0.30 can see these buttons because OSI added these cliloc texts only on this client version.
Added: New Hit Chance combat formula (more info: http://uo.stratics.com/content/arms-armor/combat.php#hitchance)
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Added new message 'msg_trade_refuse'.

26-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Sphere crash when drop an item on a invalid ground location.
Fixed: Function GOLD creating gold piles with max amount 65000 instead use ItemsMaxAmount value.

26-06-2015, XuN
Added left Racial bonuses for Elfs, Added all for Gargoyles excepting Master Artisan.
Added a missing call to Calc_CombatChanceToHit() from Fight_Attack(), making it to no check the chances to hit.
For more info about Racial bonuses, read here: http://www.uoguide.com/Racial_Abilities .
[sphere.ini]
	-Added FEATURE_ML_RACIAL_BONUS and FEATURE_SA_RACIAL_BONUS to FeatureML and FeatureSA respectively, each one activating the bonuses for human/elfs or gargoyles.

28-06-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Damages not breaking Paralyze Field spell effect.
Fixed: Explosion potions not checking LOS when it explodes.
Changed: Updated Berserk gargoyle racial trait formula added by XuN.
Changed: REFUSETRADES property now can be only used on players. NPCs won't use it anymore, since NPCs can't open trade windows.
Changed: Huge optimization on NPC_AI_EXTRA code. This is a heavy code called thousands of times per second, so unfortunately some features got removed to improve Sphere performance overall:
	-Animals (brain_animal) wont poop on ground anymore.
	-Animal Trainers (brain_animal_trainer) won't give food to nearby pets anymore.
	-Vendors won't go off-duty (brain_vendor_offduty) at night time anymore.
	PS: If someone still need these features, it can be done by scripts using @NPCAction trigger or at BUY/SELL functions on file /speech/speakshopkeep.scp
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed messages 'animal_dung' and 'npc_animal_poop'.

29-06-2015, Coruja
[sphere_defs.scp]: Removed 'brain_beggar', 'brain_thief', 'brain_undead' and 'brain_vendor_offduty'. Unfortunately these NPC brains never had worked correctly so it won't make much difference if they got removed to clean some obsolete internal codes.
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed messages 'npc_beggar_*' and 'npc_vendor_offduty'.
[speakhuman.scp]: Changed a single 'brain_thief' line to 'brain_animal_trainer' brain check on train command to match these brain changes [brain_thief -> brain_animal_trainer]
[sphere_backward_compatibility.scp]: Added backward compatibility to these 4 removed NPC brains.
[sphere_skills.scp]: Added (<ISPLAYER>) check on Tracking skill to prevent console error when an NPC try to use this skill.
[sphere_menu.scp]: Updated all obsolete ADDITEM and ADDNPC lines to ADD.

03-07-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Wrong console error text when trying to set NPC brains on players.
Fixed: Dead bonded NPCs losing gray color on corpse when client redraw the NPC on screen.
Fixed: @PersonalSpace trigger not being called when walking over chars on stairs.
Changed: Improved frozen check on walk routines and ISSTUCK function.
[sphere_monsters.scp / sphere_monsters_custom.scp]: Updated obsolete NPCs brain 'brain_undead' to 'brain_monster'.

04-07-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Combat creating blood on the attacker instead target.
Fixed: Dragons (brain_dragon) always hitting breath attack even when the target get out of LOS.
Changed: Decreased dragon breath damage. The previous formula was causing too high damages when the dragon has high hitpoints.

08-07-2015, XuN
[sphere.ini]:
-Added CombatSpeedEra to switch between speed formulas that has been changed over the years, also updated the source to reflect this addition and added fully back the formula for Legacy, it was a little tweaked.
// CombatSpeedEra
// 0 = Legacy, T2A, 55x versions..., Recommended SpeedScaleFactor = 15000, Use DEX by default to calc speed, all others use stam
// 1 = AOS,							 Recommended SpeedScaleFactor = 40000
// 2 = SE, 							 doesn't use m_iSpeedScaleFactor and it's only compatible with ML speed format eg. 0.25 ~ 5.00 seconds instead 0 ~ 50
// 3 = ML, 							 Recommended SpeedScaleFactor = 80000
CombatSpeedEra= 3	// Default is ML (3)

Note that SpeedScaleFactor must be changed along with this setting.
Tweaked CombatFormulas, they were using iDelay/2 when Fighting Skill started and generating another iDelay/2 after that period of time making it impossible to fully rewrite the value under argn1 in @HitTry.

[sphere_backwards_compatibility]:
Added some more items.

09-07-2015, Coruja
Changed: Improved some internal actions to update the client screen using less packets instead always do a full resend.

Fixed: Status (hits/mana/stam) of all chars going down to ~15 at server startup.
Changed: Small improvement on EF_Item_Strict_Comparison .ini experimental feature.
[Sphere.ini]:
	-Removed obsolete EF_Size_Optimise and EF_Intrinsic_Locals experimental flags.
	-Added missing descriptions on Experimental and OptionFlags features.

16-07-2015, Coruja
Fixed #2538: BOUNCE function not activating item decay if it got dropped on ground by overweight.
Fixed: NPCs Healer (brain_healer) resurrecting dead bonded pets (only the pet owner can resurrect it).
Fixed: Combat hit chance formula being called twice, resulting a double chance to miss the attack.

17-07-2015, Coruja
Added: New improved NPC looting AI (NPC_AI_LOOTING).
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Added 'loot_rummage' and removed 'loot_item_from', 'skillact_looting' messages.
[sphere_dialog]: Updated dialog d_charprop1 button 18.

22-07-2015, Coruja

24-07-2015, XuN
Added TAG.OVERRIDE.SPEED for ITEMDEFS and Items overriding the current speed for weapons.
Fixed #2535: NPCRestock is now accepting code like any other triggers.
Added: Setting RegenX=-1 in the ini will disable regens for that stat, also the @RegenStat trigger and every related code.
[Items/Sphere_item_provisions_weapons.scp]:
	-Added TAG.OVERRIDE.SPEED for all weapons to match new speeds on OSI, uncomment these lines to enable them (These speeds are meant to be used with CombatSpeedEra=3).
Re-added detail check for parrying messages, they were being sent always regardless of the detail flag on the character.
Re-Adeed EF_Intrinsic_Locals with a warning comment in the ini.
Fixed a check in CChar::NPC_ExtraAI() giving errors when trying to find items inside a container when there was no container to search on.

25-07-2015, Coruja
Changed: Optimized many spells and some others functions to avoid send unnecessary 'update' packets to client when it's not needed (or send it using less packets when needed).

26-07-2015, XuN
Enabled again movement packet for newer clients since blocking it was causing newer clients to do not move at all and getting 'freezed' after some steps. Added a few lines of code to UserChatButton to make this packet restrict movement when this button is being pressed, hence avoiding these injection problems.

26-07-2015, Ben
Added support for future Axis connection... (details will be available when the time comes)
Added internal support for Category,Subsection.Description and ID in SPAWN and TEMPLATE sections. they can now be accessed with (eg: serv.spawn.defname_here.category)
Also added access to ID in CHARDEF to return the real anim id of the chardef in hex. (serv.chardef.c_man.id should return 0190)

28-07-2015, Coruja
[sphere_skills.scp]: Updated TITLE on skills ArmsLore, Blacksmithing and MagicResistance.
[spheretables.scp]:
	-Updated RESOURCES using an better file order to prevent some 'undefined keyword' errors on sphere startup.
	-Fixed a small notoriety typo [Imfamous -> Infamous]

04-08-2015, Coruja
[Sphere.ini]: Added new magic flag MAGICF_OVERRIDEFIELDS to prevent cast multiple field spells on the same tile, making the new field tile remove the previous field.
Changed: If there's multiple field spells on the same tile and MAGICF_OVERRIDEFIELDS is disabled, now only the first field will make effect (this will prevent some weird exploits like cast multiple Fire Field spells on the same tile to take more damage, etc).

06-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed #2541: Client screen not being updated correctly on resurrect.
Fixed: Players randomly switching to previous targets on combat.
Fixed: Client sending unnecessary mana/stam update to party members when opening the status menu.
Added: Missing Polymorph spell duration formula when MAGICF_OSIFORMULAS feature is enabled.

07-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Random 'walk resync' problems.

Fixed #2539: Combat damages always creating blood using default color (red) instead follow BLOODCOLOR property.

09-08-2015, Coruja
Changed: Major improvements and optimizations on internal Hit / HitTry combat calls.
Changed: Combat swing behavior got slightly changed to be more accurate.
	-Now instead the animation speed match the swing delay duration and only do the damage at the end, the animation/damage will always occour on first 7ms and then it will keep waiting the remaining time until next swing.
	-This makes all anims/sounds perfectly match the damage timer no matter the weapon type or swing delay timer.

13-08-2015, matex
Added: OVERRIDE.NPCAI to control AI-flags on a per character basis if necessary. Otherwise NPCAI flag from sphere.ini is used.

15-08-2015, matex
Added: EF_DynamicBackgroundsave. This will enable, if necessary, if a backgroundsave tick is triggered to save more than only one Sector. 
This especially makes sense if the map has a lot of sectors. E.g. if the sectorsize deviates from 64x64 as completion of a single backgroundsave
takes circa 40 minutes with a sectorsize of 32x32 and BACKGROUNDSAVE set to 1. Using dynamic backgroundsaving this can be sped up at the cost of
some performance. You can approximately limit the amount of items/characters that will be saved as the Operation will just stop if it estimated that
saving another sector would exceed SaveStepMaxComplexity. You can further limit how many sectors will be saved at maximum per backgroundsave-tick using SaveSectorsPerTick. This is a maximum value. If the maximum complexity is exceeded it may not reach that maximum value.
Added: SECTOR.INACTIVECOUNT. Will report the number of logged-out chararacters inside that sector.

16-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Walk packet events causing excessive CPU/bandwidth usage.

17-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Char property Regen[Hits/Mana/Stam] not working correctly.
Changed: Updated internal MySQL libs version 4.1.18 to 6.1.6. 

19-08-2015, Coruja

Fixed: Rubberband when using combat skills while running.
Fixed: World teleports incorrectly showing teleport spell animation.
Fixed: Tracking skill showing empty messages instead not show any message at all when the tracking messages are blank on sphere_msgs.scp.

21-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed: NPCs (brain_monster) always trying to apply poison on hit, even if the NPC doesn't have poisoning skill or poisoned weapons.
Fixed: NPCs not moving when step on Fire Field spell.
Fixed: Tactics skill too difficult to gain on combat.
Fixed: Explosion potion not flagging criminal when hit someone.
Fixed: Spells disturb not working correctly in some specific cases.
Fixed: Missing paperdoll update when char ID (body) get changed.
[Sphere.ini] Removed COMBAT_PREHIT combat flag, it can be replaced by AttackingIsaCrime which does the same thing.
[sphere_defs.scp]: Added new 'dam_nodisturb' damage flag.

25-08-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Food items not restoring char FOOD correctly.
Fixed: HitLeech[Life/Mana/Stam] and HitManaDrain properties making hits/mana/stam rise over the max char limit.
[sphere_spells.scp]: Removed SOUND / EFFECT_ID from Teleport spell. These values are already handled by Sphere.ini settings, and sphere_spells.scp values was making it play twice.

27-08-2015, Coruja
Added: New STEPSTEALTH char property to set how many steps the char can walk invisible while using Stealth skill. This property is set when using Stealth skill, will decrease -1 on each walk step (or -2 if running) and will reveal when reach 0.
Changed: Trigger @StepStealth no longer use ARGN1 to force reveal, the ARGN1=1 can be replaced by STEPSTEALTH=0.
Fixed: Missing buff icon when using INVIS (GM command).
[sphere_skills.scp]: New Stealth softcoded skill.
	-IMPORTANT: It's HIGHLY recommended update it, or this skill will stop working.

28-08-2015, XuN
Changed the way SPAWNS works, improved them and added more access functions:
	- Removed MEMORY_ISPAWNED from source (still present as a def in sphere_defs.scp for backwards-compat)
	- Updated SpawnItem to point directly to the spawn instead of redirecting to memory's link.
	- Moved SpawnItem (R) to COjbBase to affect both chars and items.
	- Spawned OBJs are now stored in the spawn, so SpawnItem only gives quick access to the spawn.
	- Functions added to spawns:
		- AT.n.KEY (R): Retrieves the 'KEY' val for the 'n' spawned item/char, examples: <at.0.name>, <at.0.str>...
		- COUNT (R): Returns the total count of spawned items or chars.
		- RESET (W): Removes every spawned Item/Char.
		- STOP (W): Removes every spawned Item/Char and stops the Spawn.
		- START (W): Same as DClicking the Spawn, but from function, without LOS/Distance/etc limitations (It just makes it start, doesn't reset it, so won't work if it's already working).
		- ADDOBJ uid (W): Adds the given UID(the Item/Char must exist obviously, so it must be created before) to the Spawned list, it doesn't check for MORE2 < AMOUNT or anything, it's a forced add. Example:
				ON=@GetHit
					REF1=<SpawnItem>
					SERV.NEWNPC=<baseid>
					NEW.P=<P>
					NEW.FLAGS |= STATF_CONJURED
					REF1.ADDOBJ=<NEW>
		- DELOBJ uid (W): The opossite of ADDOBJ, removes one OBJ from this list (just remove from the list, it's not removing the OBJ itself).
NOTE: While updating for this build, when server is loading for first time and converting MEMORY_ISPAWNED to SpawnItem and removing these memories, Sphere will throw a memory_leak exception after loading the world because of the difference between items before loading (chars with memory_ispawned) and items after loading (memory_ispawned removed).

Added PREVBUILD storing in the worldsaves the current BUILD (__GITREVISION__), usefull to apply changes when updating the bin. Usage: <SERV.PrevBuild>

07-09-2015, XuN
Changed iSwingDelay from CChar::Fight_Hit to CResource::Calc_CombatAttackSpeed to prevent double checks for speeds 'lower than' and to avoid guard's speed to be overriden if GuardsInstantKill=1
Also changed AnimDelay from @HitTry to initially have a duration of argn1 -=7, so this can be softcoded to match 'old style' by just adding a simple +=7
Updated fighting delays to match again the 'real' delay removing a tick from the delay (as the fighting proccess is starting in the next tick).
Fixed #2554: SkillUseQuick not checking for SKF_SCRIPTED
Fixed #2553: Animations not being displayed when fighting with COMBATF_NODIRCHANGE
Fixed #2547: Dragons will be tracked as Monsters
Fixed Tracking not displaying the direction of the target in the given message.

Fixed #2558: errors thrown when CombatSpeedEra=0 and Weapons had no SPEED defined.

Fixed HitLeechLife/Stam/Mana not giving the corrent amount of hits/stam/mana
CHANGED tag.override.sound_hit to AMMOSOUNDHIT and tag.override.sound_miss to AMMOSOUNDMISS to match other AMMO* properties.

25-09-2015, Coruja
Fixed: Console error when players call "Guards".
Added: Better user-friendly description to server exit codes. Now the console will show "Server terminated: [reason][code]" instead "Server terminated by error [code]".

28-09-2015, Coruja
Fixed: NPCs not facing target when starting combat swings.
Added: New 'DYE <uid>' function to open dye gump on selected UID.

01-10-2015, XuN
Fixed combat swings being aborted when range was not in the required limits regardless of COMBATF_STAYINRANGE enabled or disabled.
ReAdded COMBATF_PREHIT since AttackingIsaCrime is the setting used now to handle notoriety checks, and prehit is used to create a different combat style on some servers dealing damage first and recoaling after.
Added #2560: @TARGON_CANCEL will fire on chars now when closing a target created by TARGETF*, ARGS = function.
[sphere.ini]
	-Added: LootingReveal, setting this to 1 will force your character to be revealed when looting corpses that don't belong to you.
