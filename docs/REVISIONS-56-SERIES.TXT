Fixed: A rarely occuring bug when importing characters: Sometimes when characters are imported, there is a chance for identical items at same place (in backpack), which are deleted. This shouldn't happen anymore.
Fixed: Importing items with same BASEID and different DISPID at the same place in world removes one of the items unexpectedly. This is especially the case for WSC imports, where same DISPIDs of the same BASEID are is almost always intended.
