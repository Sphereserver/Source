
---- 0.56a --------------------------------------------------------------------
---- 08/12/2004

06-10-04, Vjaka
- Removed DISGUISE(NAME/VERSION), renamed the current version to 0.56a.

07-10-04, Vjaka
- Removed AGREE config line neccessaty since it is not longer R* series.
- Added startup expansion set support output depending on map*,statics*,staidx*
  files found and loaded (T2A, LBR, AOS, SE).
- Removed EF_New_Maps since it is integrated to source now, packet is sent when
  needed.
- Moving on other map now moves the same map on the server. But this currently
  does not use caching and re-read tile information from map files every time.
  Caching of same sectors but in different mapplanes will be in the future.
  You should both add regions for these maps, and place corresponding files in
  place where all other mul files resides.
- Changed values of EXPERIMENTAL flags to remove empty slots between items.

08-10-04, Vjaka
- Fixed memory leak caused by map cache removal.
- Fixed client screen update on map change.

08-10-04, Furio
- Added PROMPTCONSOLE, it makes the client prompt (like on page request) and send
  the response as an argument of a user definied function.
  (syntax PROMPTCONSOLE callback function, message to prompt)

10-10-04, Furio
- Added RESDISP properties to account. Accepted values are 0 (PreT2a client),
  1 (T2A), 2 (LBR), 3 (AoS), 4 (Samurai Empire). This is used to identify what type
  of client is logged in. As default is set at 0, but if the client is T2A is
  automatically set to 1 by Sphere. LBR, AoS and SE is not setted automatically and
  is leaved to you.
- Added to CHARDEF properties RESLEVEL, RESDISPDNID, RESDISPDNHUE. The first state
  from what UO version the anim comes. The second what anim id is showed to older
  client version. The third an hue showed to older client (if 0 or null the default
  anim hue is used.
- Modified scriptpack to reflect these changes for T2A monsters.

22-10-04, Vjaka
- Added <dVALUE> as a shortcut to <eval <VALUE>> to get a decimal value of a
  single expr like a variable. Note, this affects EF_Intrinsic_Locals a bit.
- Commands with .command and spaces before will be treated as without spaces,
  since extra space makes privileged chars to reveal self.
- Added TAG.PARTY_CANLOOTME for party. If 1, allows party to loot self.
- Added @Kill trigger (SRC-killer, ARGO-killed)
- Added sector function ALLCHARS,ALLITEMS similar to ALLCLIENTS. For regions
  you can use SECTORS.ALLCHARS, SECTORS.ALLITEMS.
- Changed GODPORT to accept port number as well. Old values ( <=0 = disables,
  1=ServPort+1000) are still working also.
- Added SYSCMD and SYSSPAWN commands to run external applications. Returns <0 if
  there was an error. The first one blocks while program is running while the
  second spawns and continues scripts execution. Due to obvious security fear
  in these commands, they are disabled if OF_FileCommands is not set. Up to 9
  command line arguments are passed to the external application.

23-10-04, Furio
- Fixed minor things in grayproto.
- Updated grayproto (list/sizes of Uo packet in Sphere).
- Finished and debugged the new crypt engine (for crypt clients). Currently up
  to latest current OSI client 4.0.5a is supported.

25-10-04, Vjaka
- Fixed exception in writefile when unable to open the file.
- Added account name output when packet dispatch generated an exception.

25-10-2004. Furio
- Still updated grayproto, with new packet infos.

26-10-04, Vjaka
- Fixed SMSG[u] resolve error.
- Fixed <dSOMEVAL> giving some hex results.
- Added update for items moved by NPCs when they blocks the path.

27-10-04, Vjaka
- Now Windows build tryes to use winsock 2.0 if available instead of 1.1.
- Added amount argument to NEWITEM (newitem i_gold,45). Defaults to 1.
- Removed one of occasions with creating an extra log not in logfile path.

27-10-04, Furio
- Fixed a bug in displaying big dialogs with newer clients (4.0.X).
- Fixed a bug where some clients were crashing when adding an item.

28-10-04, Vjaka
- Disabled string 'q'/'Q' to be said by privileged accounts. It is due the
  fact that default macro for repeat is Ctrl+Q, and one less Ctrl press will
  lead to GM to reveal self existance around, which really is not good.

31-10-04, Furio
- Some fixes related to account creation and bank/box hack.
- Removed EF_AgeOfShadows. It'll be re-added with new features and complete
  compatibility for older clients, when enabled.
- Fixed another exploit with Bullettin Boards. Thx to Balkon for reporting it.

01-11-04, Vjaka
- Added .pid file existance notification to warn for double sphere launches.

02-11-04, Vjaka

- One more cause for long default message string lookups removed.
- EQUIPHALO now takes an argument - time to work on a person.
- Fixed bug causing objects calculated to be in sector 0 always.
- Added @Destroy trigger for objects.

04-11-04, Vjaka
- Quickfix of OF_Magic_PreCast - now not precasting on NPCs.
- Consume now can take more than 65k at once.
- Added @CreatePlayer to trigger just after the char was created by a player.

05-11-04, Vjaka
- Now "Admin" is shown instead of "GM" if person is admin or owner in title.

06-11-04, Vjaka
- Added sector function ALLCHARSIDLE similar to ALLCHARS, but looping via
  disconnected/mounted/etc chars, not accessable by ALLCHARS.
- Added auto map fix to zero map if it is out of bounds. Please note, that
  this can cause some problems with MOREM usage as well.

25-11-04, Furio
- Fixed: encryption - client login.
- Fixed: dVALUE evaluating when VALUE is already int.
- Fixed: EQUIPHALO <timer> does not making the light disappearing.
- Updated supported clients to 4.0.6a.
- Removed "Cannot move here!" message.
- Added more information to "MOVE: empty region" error. (uid and point)

30-11-04, Furio
- Fixed: MOREM automatically converted to 0 because of new multi-map feature.
- Added MasterUid property to guildstones

02-12-04, Furio
- Fixed: Gm Page menu not sending gms on page select.
- Fixed: Lord is displayed without space.
- Fixed: TAGAT trying to access to non existing TAGs.

08-12-04, Furio
- Fixed: EvaluatingIntel on 0 int NPCs.
- Fixed: EQUIPHALO light disappearing on Dispel.

08-12-04, Vjaka
- Fixed exploit submitting invalid amount in buy packet giving free resources
  (thanks Breaker and Fallout for reporting this).
- Fixed canmove to accept DIR values (0..8) in addition to a letter arguments.
  Same changes affects other places, like move command, etc.
- File locking method optimised. It should improve the multithreading a bit.
- Result of the old "ACCOUNT accname" command changed to be more informational.
- GMs should login with invul and without allshow flags set.
- If reference set to OBJ/NEW does not exist, zero will be storied instead. And
  opposite, if it is already deleted, OBJ/NEW value is cleared to zero.
- Fixed exception in f_onaccount_login.

08-12-2004, Various authors
- Fixed some scripts by Vjaka.
- Added new scripts and scripts fixes by Tattooed Corpse.

---- 0.56b --------------------------------------------------------------------
---- * not released yet

09-12-04, Vjaka
- Added map caching supporting all maps. Due to this, sectors are no longer
  same in the same spot in different maps, allowing local settings for maps.
- Added ADDCIRCLE=x[,y] to add a circle to a character's spellbook. If y is on,
  includes all lower spell circles as well.
- File locking method optimised. It should improve the multithreading a bit.
- Changed [SECTOR x,y] in world saves to x,y,0,map to allow local settings for
  sectors in different maps. Old format will default to map 0.
- Since sectors are no longer shared witheen different maps, sectors on maps,
  unsupported by server (having no corresponding .mul files) do not get ticks.
- Fixed cause to duplicate saved items in static saves in several occasions.
- Added BADSPAWN command to jump to the first bad spawn found in the world. You
  should add this to some of the [PLEVEL records. It also saves the UID into
  ACT in case you unable to see it due to some obstacles.
- Removed useless PRIVHIDE (privshow 0/1 is enough for this).

10-12-04, Vjaka
- Fixed some defmessages misprint making unable to override them.
- Fixed @Kill to trigger even if the killer is not an agressor in the fight.
- Changed MAPPLANE->MAP, LOCALLIGHT->LIGHT (.56a supported both variants, but
  saved the second). Launch and save in .56a will autoconvert this in saves.
- Now any items with ATTR_STATIC are saved to spherestatics.scp, not only those
  who has this flag being the only set.
- Fixed carriage return in accounts unused message.

11-12-04, Furio
- Fixed: bugs with FORCONT* loops.
- Fixed: bug with coloured text in comm crystal.
- Added: SKILLGAIN function to call internal sphere skillgain function. Args are
  skill to gain and difficulty (0 to 100).
- Added: REPORTEDCLIVER property for clients. It'll contain the version that
  the client is. (this is easy fakeable by 3rd party programs, but still is
  useful)

13-12-04, Vjaka
- Fixed resolving functions executing on containers, if the name started from
  rescount,restest,fcount or count.
- Fixed isneartype not working if calling under points (like from TARGP).

17-12-04, Vjaka
- Account delete information now contains account name.
- Added NPC keyword GOTO x,y,z,map to execute sphere default movements there.
- Redone pathfinding to support separate thread execution, so it now utilizes
  extra thread if OF_Multithreaded is set.
- Advanced AI now includes food search on hunger to eat and gather meal around.
  It is executed in separate thread with pathfinding if configured so.

21-12-04, Vjaka
- Changed sector allocations, now allocates only those who are needed by the
  server depending on the *.mul files found. Thus, on bare t2a install no space
  for other maps will be allocated (saves several Mbytes).
- Random selection {x y} now supports format {x,y} also. Should help using it
  with DAM/AR fields of items.
- Added EXP field to characters. No internal support for it yet. But you can
  use it in scripts already.
- Empty accounts file is created on-fly if not found. Useful for unpack-n-run.
- Fixed bug with TOTALCONNECTTIME being increased by doubled value, and now is
  made more accurate.
- Optimized the UID allocation routine, trying to disallow creating holes in
  objects allocation. This should improve memory neccessaty increase for large
  or long-lasting servers. Howewer, this does not defrag the current save, only
  newly generated UIDs will be optimized - no existant UIDs will be altered.
  Garbage Collection should be enabled for this optimization to work.
- Expanded account information in ACCOUNT NAME command by logged char name.

03-01-05, Vjaka
- Added <Rarguments> as a shortcut to <eval rand(arguments)>. Can take either
  one, two or no arguments like <R>, <R15>, <R3,15>. If no arguments given,
  R1000 is assumed.
- You can now disable broadcast messages (like errors, connects, etc) from the
  server log to be sent to your account logged via telnet. You can toggle this
  behavior per account via PRIV field of the account (mask 0400). So, only
  responces to your commands and some very-basic messages (like world save)
  will be sent in this case.

08-01-05, Vjaka
- Added support for virtual maps. Now map numbers 0..255 are supported by the
  server.
- Map dimensions are now customizable in INI-file using by the following cmd:
  MAPx=max_x,max_y,sector_size,real_map_number.
  Here x - the map number for ingame useage (4rd coordinate of the coordinate).
  max_x - maximal X coordinate of the map (should be multiply of 8).
  max_y - maximal Y coordinate of the map (should be multiply of 8).
  sector_size - the sector size (you can play with this if you experience lags
    decreasing this value (should be multiply of 8 and both max_x and max_y).
  real_map_numer - number used by map files (like: 0 for map0, statics0).
  You can also change some attribute of the current map not redefining all
  values, skipping the ones you wish to be as default putting 0 instead (for
  real map number -1). For example, decreasing sector size for map 0 to 16
  from default value of 64 will look in INI file thus: "MAP0=0,0,16,-1".
  Please note, that no changes are applied when server is already started.
- Default map numbering has been changed (you can ovverride it easily by MAPx
  setting in sphere.ini). Now 0 = map0, 1 = map0, 2 = map2, 3 = map3, 4 = map4.

10-01-05, Furio
- Added: tooltip %d command for gumps (works in SE clients).
- Added: sphere_map*.scp/sphere_map_points*.scp for new maps and fixed the
  default one.
- Updated: gray proto with new packets.
- Updated: client support to 4.0.7 family.
- Updated: fix in default script pack.

13-01-05, Furio
- Modified SERV.MAP(x,y) to accept a 3rd parameter, the map. If omitted is
  defaulted to 0.
- Added SECTOR access to read-only properties from a point. Example:
  SERV.MAP(100,100,1).SECTOR.ITEMCOUNT will give you the itemcount of the
  sector that contains the point 100,100 on map 1.
- Added REGION access to read-only properties from a point. (works like
  SECTOR one)
- Fixed: gumppic to show hue when used. (Hue usable only for client >= 3)

15-01-05, Vjaka
- Changed the way the server saves allowing more information about the cause of
  some exception (which is now not fatal for the save).

17-01-05, Vjaka
- Added LEVEL field to char as the future part of the experience system.
- Added ExperienceSystem, ExperienceMode, LevelSystem, LevelMode, LevelNextAt
  fields to the .INI file as a future part of the experience system. Read the
  default sphere.ini for more description over these fields.
- PRIV flags are now auto-clearing bits corresponding to not used priv. This is
  a solution for a possible incompatibility when the previosely disabled bit
  will be reused with other functionality on same world saves.
- Fixed: LAYER_EXTRA is now used ONLY to place the items bought by the vendor.
- Items sold to vendors are auto-deleted exactly upon the sell operation. The
  only case they are saved, if they are sold to player vendors.
- Amount of items in sell packet is now limited to the container size.
- Fixed one more sell/buy exploit.

17-01-05, Furio
- Fixed: party system.
- Fixed: group disappeared from gumps.
- Added: scriptable components for the party. Still work in progress.
  With <REF>.PARTY refer to the current party of the char.
  	   <REF>.PARTY.MEMBER.x refer to any member of the party.
       <REF>.PARTY.MASTER refer to the master of the party.
  PARTY.MEMBERS give the count of members
  PARTY.MEMBER.x has also ISMASTER and ISLOOTABLE properties.
  PARTY.ADDMEMBER[FORCED] you can add a meber by script (forced  version works
       without the normal /accept behaviour)
  PARTY.DISBAND disband the current party
  PARTY.REMOVEMEMBER @<N> remove the Nth member
  PARTY.REMOVEMEMBER <UID> remove a member in the party with the UID given
       (if is the master the party is disbanded)
  PARTY.SYSMESSAGE @<N> TEXT send a party sysmessage to the Nth member
  PARTY.SYSMESSAGE <UID> TEXT send a party sysmessage to a member in the party
       with the UID given
  PARTY.SYSMESSAGE TEXT send a sysmessage to the party
  PARTY.MESSAGE @<M> TEXT send a message from the Mth member to the party
  PARTY.MESSAGE @<M>,<N> TEXT send a message from the Mth member to the Nth
       member
  PARTY.MESSAGE <UID1> TEXT send a message from the <UID1> to the party
  PARTY.MESSAGE <UID1>,<UID2> TEXT send a message from <UID1> member to <UID2>
- Added: TAG/TAG0 for party.

24-01-05, Vjaka
- Fixed bug with some keywords recognition caused by <Rxxx> operator.
- Chardef triggers do not apply to players now.
- Write deleted accounts out to log file

25-01-05, Vjaka
- Fixed vendor selling in case of one item being sold.
- Ensure double character removal from view in "remove 1" case (for allshow).

26-01-05, Vjaka
- Fixed registry settings overriding MULFILES setting in some cases in win32.
- Fixed the way spells are checked whatever they are in a spellbook. New type
  of spellbook (186) has been added for script purposes with internal support.
  Now the spellbooks (if not default one) can be configured to specify which
  number of the lowest spell it contains (stored in MOREZ).
- Fixed casting speel with two or more similar spell books when it does not
  exist in one of these books.
- Removed limitation to 1 byte (255) for MOREZ of spellbooks. Now it can hold
  2 bytes (65535). Please note, that setting MOREZ via MOREP is incorrect here.

28-01-05, Vjaka
- Fixed bug caused with layer_extra removal from buy menu in older clients.
- Added support for packets filterings. Please note, that you should understand
  what are you doing. You can install your handler of a packet X specifying
  PACKETx=functionname. This function will be called when the packet is going
  to be processed by the server. It has the following arguments set:
  ARGN1 = packet number (to allow using one function for different packets)
  ARGS = source client ip address
  LOCAL.0-LOCAL.9 - first 10 bytes of the packet for parsing contents
  If you do return 1 in this function, the packet will NOT be processed.
- Some exceptions debug messaging speed optimised.

29-01-05, Vjaka
- Added argument for RECRUIT on guildstone. If set 1, the member recruited will
  become a fully qualifyed member of a guild with abbriviation shown on.

30-01-05, Furio
- Fixed: compatibility problems on Linux.
- Freeze for 0.56b Test1.

03-02-05, Vjaka
- Argument switches of target[f][g][w] functions can be given in any order.
- Fixed removing events on other events execution that leaded skipping others.
- Memory usage is lowered (pre-storage optimized for more accurate values),
  approx 30-40% less memory will be used (depending on load structure).

04-02-05, Vjaka
- Logout now quits from chat removing problems with inactive zombies left.
- Characters with Statf_STONE cannot logout (actualy, have 1 hour logout timer).
- You can now access account properties using SERV.ACCOUNT.x. reference where x
  is the numerical index of the account (0..SERV.ACCOUNTS) [read-only]
- Fixed extra step made on sector borders.
- Fixed "return"/"return 2" in chardef triggers stopping others from launching.

04-02-05, Furio
- Added support for 4.0.8 clients.
- Fixed some arguments parsing in party functions

05-02-05, Vjaka
- Optimized time profiling on ticking objects.

07-02-05, Vjaka
- Problem with items left with switching virtual maps with one physical should
  be solved.
- Added simple mySQL support. New settings MySqlHost, MySqlUser, MySqlPassword,
  MySqlDatabase will be used to connect to the DB in case if MYSQL is set to 1.
  You will need extra .dll/.so to download for sphere installation. They will
  join the packages.

08-02-05, Vjaka
- Fixed several map support bugs with incorrect sector counting (should improve
  support of a high map numbers).

11-02-05, Vjaka
- Fixed bug causing incorrect function name lookup in several cases with some
  special chars like underline (_).
- Added debug flags 0200 and 0400 to debug experience and level changes from
  server console (if enabled).
- Experience system integrated. Few addons about defaults to config comments:
  a) experience bonus for crafting counted as a value/100.
  b) default experience set on create is str+dex/2+int.
  c) manual setting experience will alter level if configured so.
  d) dying decreases experience by 10%
  e) killing enemy will give experience depending on exp and level of target.

12-02-05, Vjaka
- Added 2 more EXP settings to config: ExperienceKoefPVP and ExperienceKoefPVM,
  controlling percents of gaining experience in PvP and PvM combat.
- Added triggers @ExpChange and @ExpLevelChange, where ARGN1 (writeable) is the
  change is going to happen. Returning 1 cancels the change.

12-02-05, Furio
- Fixed: another buffer overrun exploit in log system. Thx to Radiant for
  reporting it.
- Added: SUPPRESSCAPITALS (default 0) to enable/disable Vjaka system to avoid
  long text written only in capital letters.

14-02-05, Vjaka
- OF_Advanced_AI is now obsolete. Currently it is controlled by NPCAI setting
  in config file.
- Added MaxLoopTimes value to config (default 10000) to limit a number of
  iterations the while/for cycle could have to remove possible deadlocks making
  server to stop responding (better use this instead of main loop restart).
- Added MOVERATE to CHARDEFs. It is the percent modifier of the speed of the
  NPC - the higher it is, the slower will the NPC be. Default is 100.
- Now double clicking on the log window in windows build will bring up an
  editor with corresponded file (if any specifyed in the same line) opened.

15-02-05, Vjaka
- Fixed one more buy menu exploit (probably, the last one) ;).
- Fixed NEWITEM id,amount in case if non-exact value was given (like {x y}).
- Added cont argument to NEWITEM (now it looks NEWITEM id,amount,container).

16-02-05, Furio
- Fixed: compatibility things for Linux/BSD build.

27-02-05, Furio
- Added: STRREV for strings.
- Reverted to dynamic linked executable for the linux build. That permit some
  exception handling during signal raise.

01-03-05, Vjaka
- Fixed gaining fame and exp on summoned pets.
- Faster and more intelligent protection from fastloot like ,emptycontainer. The
  delays for picking now are 0.3 sec per item. Item with amount (popping dialog
  with input) adds extra 0.2 sec delay.

04-03-05, Vjaka
- Fixed an exploit with invalid book packet (thanks Fallout for reporting).
- Fixed @Destroy event not fired.
- Added the minimal delay before accepting sell/buy deal equal to 0.3 sec per
  each item. This limits the power of autobuy/autosell/inject sell all.
- Added client property CTAG similar to the TAG array. The difference is that
  the contents is not saved, and is destroyed upon logout - useful place to
  store your local variables on the client character.

06-03-05, Furio
- Some other fixes to improve Linux build stability.
- Now killing sphere with HUP make the server save and exit.
- Added support for 4.0.9 client encryption.
- Added more comprehensible messages to error output (bad login / garbage / save)

10-03-05, Vjaka
- Fixed placing items from invalid containers upon save loading to world nearby
  100,100 coords, these items should be deleted, so they are.
- Limited amount of items shown to client on screen to MaxItemComplexity*30 (by
  default 25*30 = 750).
- Removed goldreserve from guilds - use TAGs for this.
- Windows: added build date and time to the About box along with the version.

13-03-05, Furio
- Added SERV.GUILDSTONES.x to referer to the Xth guildstone in the server.
  Use SERV.GUILDSTONES.COUNT to get the total number.
- Added SERV.TOWNSTONES working like SERV.GUILDSTONES.
- Added MasterUid property also in write mode. Now you can change the guild
  master passing the uid as argument.
- Some minor fix to Linux build.

14-03-05, Vjaka
- Optimised object los check, should decrease waste of cpu on large shards.
- Fixed possible webpage exploit with malformed requests.
- Removed EMAIL property from accounts and all associated commands (EMAIL/
  ADDEMAIL,defmessages) - use account TAGs to work with it when needed.
- Removed server status responce from the standart ping/telnet connection.
- Fixed logging in localy when both RemoteAdmin and Administrator accounts were
  not found and LOCALIPADMIN was set.
- Fixed misprinted defmessage ncp_* to npc_* (2 matches), sphere_msgs.scp now
  comes commented by default - uncomment things only you need to change - most
  people will not need this file at all, so by this way we show that.

14-03-05, Furio
- Temp removed "Limited amount of items shown to client on screen".
- Moved FOLLOW from exe to scripts. Now MEMORY_FOLLOW(01000) is unused.
- Modified default info gump with a new one (thx to NHR).

17-03-05, Vjaka
- Removed EF_No_Pause_Packet, it is built in to code now.
- Drop item on vendor to trade quick, removed npc_vendor_sell (from 1.0).
- Setting SLEEPMASK=0 will give no time to sleeping sectors (from 1.0).
- Optimised few widely used checks like touch check.

29-03-05, Vjaka
- Removed debug message about not found pathfinding path.
- Fixed bug causing objects disappear on doubleclick.
- "Limited amount of items shown to client on screen" is back due this was not
  the cause of the previous bug ;).
- Removed verbose command. It was anyhow very limited in Release build.
- Added -c command line switch to WIN32 build. It allows changing registered
  class name for sphere, which helps working via windows messages with several
  sphere servers on the same machine.

05-04-05, Vjaka
- Made ARGN1 writeable in @Hunger.
- Fixed OptionFlags display instead of MagicIngoreAR.

11-04-05, Vjaka
- Packet filtering support heavily expanded. Now you have these variables:
  LOCAL.NUM (value) set to amount of data got from the packet
  LOCAL.STR (string) all data threated as a string (aware of zero chars)
  LOCAL.ACCOUNT (string) current active account if any is logged by the client
  LOCAL.CHAR (uid) current active char if any is logged in from the client
  and the all data is now given in LOCAL.x, not the only first 10 bytes.
- Returning 1 in PACKETx handler function no longer shows Bad Msg Eat string.
- Removing exception on invalid map point in some drop cases.
- Account named like account keywords (ADD/BLOCKED/etc) denied for creation.

12-04-05, Vjaka
- Walking via others with no penalty fixed (now it more like it was before in
  the times of 55i - more correct way). You can override this by changing ARGN1
  in @PersonalSpace trigger.
- Fixed message of guard owners always saying previous region guards owners.

14-04-05, Vjaka
- Fixed Sphere accepting a player character as a valid guard in some cases.
- Fixed guard walking to enemy even if they are cheaters (instantkill enabled).
- Added messaging flood control - equal sysmessages one after another will not
  be sent to the client (if they are absolutely identifical and no any other
  message was between them).
- Added STRIP [DIR/] console command. Reads all scripts and outputs them to new
  files with only [...], and base definitions lines. Good for giving script to
  your gms to be able to use axis with very basic information.

17-04-05, Vjaka
- Fixed bug with quick trade on player vendors.
- Fixed an exception caused by empty messages in some client events.

21-04-05, Furio
- Added 4.0.10 client keys.
- Fixed: bugs in getting vals from party.

21-04-05, Vjaka
- Fixed some cases (not all!) of scripts clearence by specifying incorrect
  directory in STRIP command. There are too many ways to specify direct or
  indirect path that will look different but will lead to the same file
  starting from symlinks, ending with messing with .. and dir seprarators (\/).
  Locking the file is not ok, since it will cause problems with other threads
  or applications working with file. So use this either with care, or with no
  argument ;)
- Added Axis tags support CATEGORY, SUBSECTION, DESCRIPTION to STRIP command. I
  do not use them, so did not add that when making the command :).

23-04-05, Furio
- Some fixes and optimization for Linux code.

03-05-05, Vjaka
- Fixed bug causing impossibility to dress off items in some cases.
- Removed background task and all corresponding to it operations, since they
  only looked as working, while doing almost nothing.

14-05-2005, Furio
- Fixed some bugs in client detection.
- Fixed a bug for too short account name login.
- Removed support for encrypted client from 1.25.31 to 1.26.4 (you can use them
  only in unencrypted way).

- Fixed problems with rand(x,y).
- Disabled (temp.) Vjaka's messaging flood control.

24-05-05, Furio
- Fixed some bugs for Linux build.
- Added CanSee check in spellcast.

25-05-05, Vjaka
- Added OF_Flood_Protection as a control of toggling appearence of same
  messages and sysmessages one after another. Note, that this setting is always
  off for PLEVEL 2 or upper, so GMs will always get everything.
- Fixed copses giving unlimited blood amount. Now, the corpse gets TAG.BLOOD
  upon creation to TAG.MAXBLOOD of itemdef. You can also alter TAG.BLOOD upon
  creation on the coprse object. The default value is 5.
- Due to multiply requests, TAG.LastLogged is removed just after showing it to
  client. It is still there for the purpose to show real last connection date.
- Added INI setting of MOVERATE (default 100) to change the default moving
  speed of all NPCs at once. Remember, this is percent setting.
- Fixed bless and curse on items which lead to ultimate stats raise.

28-05-05, Furio

- Fixed: CTAG sysmessage on set.
- Fixed: FVAL bug.

18-06-05, Vjaka

- Fixed exception on allshow.
- Fixed console errors when using looms and repair.

27-06-05, Vjaka
- Removed RESOURCES2 line since it never worked at all.
- Fixed variety of bugs with using some keywords like newitem from functions
  called directly from the server (like f_onserver_start). Special char is
  created for this purpose to be acting as a default object.
- Region now executes command for all sectors inside if the command is sector
  one (you can use REGION.all* instead of REGION.SECTORS.all*) for example.
  REGION.SECTORS command is depricated.
- Added StatsFlags setting to cap MAX(HITS/MANA/STAM) status.

01-07-05, Vjaka
- Added f_onserver_exit triggered on server quit. Quite useless since no saves
  are occured after then, but good for launching some prog using sysspawn.
- Townstones are now listed in status using TOWNLIST command, splitting town
  and guild stones to different links.
- Fixed calling guards on self.

03-07-05, Vjaka
- Fixed fightself bug. It was not fixed before. I did not notice that since do
  not use default summon creature spell. Thanks Handred for reporting.
- Trying to improve the rate and distance NPC sees characters around. Now it
  should happen faster, since higher distance is checked in areas with little
  complexity.
- Spawning NPC distance is now more random. Also now spawning checks the
  borders inside disallowing to spawn in unaccessable place. Thus, if you place
  spawn in house and the doors are closed, there is no possibility for NPC to
  spawn outside the house.
- The death now triggers inventory close to avoid appearing fake items inside
  that are no longer in the pack.

04-07-05, Vjaka
- Fixed impossibility to change type of the object to a non-default one.

08-07-05, Furio

  (the list is here http://www.scit.wlv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/mansec?3C+strftime ).
  e.g SERV.RTIME.FORMAT %d returns the number of the day.
- Fixed: animal trainer problem with EF_Walkcheck.
- Fixed: magic lock/unlock bugs.
- Fixed: dagger on static crop.

19-07-05, Vjaka

25-07-05, Furio
- Fixed: npc try to attack mounts causing exceptions.
- Fixed: mounts disappearing. (thx to Gygrazok and Darkraven)
- Fixed: args not used in trigger @PersonalSpace. (thx to Darkraven)
- Fixed: Map teleports teleporting npcs.
- Added: 4th argument to map teleports. If is set to 1 npcs can use the teleport.
	By default is 0. Eg: 1,1,1,0=100,100,100,0=my_teleport=1 is enabled,
	1,1,1,0=100,100,100,0=my_teleport=0 or 1,1,1,0=100,100,100,0=my_teleport is
	disabled.

27-07-05, Vjaka
- Fixed: Several exceptions with latest client.

30-07-05, Cloud_Br (Script pack)
- Fixed: problems with spherechars_se.scp
- Added: defs to sphere_backward_compatibility.scp
- Fixed: some areas without guards (map0/map1).

30-07-05, Vjaka
- Added: MySQL support to scripts. You can execute any queries and statements,
  as well as get data from mysql link. A special script object similar to the
  FILE or OBJ added and is named DB.
  DB Properties:
    CONNECTED - the current state of database connection (1 or 0)
	ROW.NUMROWS - number of rows returned by last query
	ROW.NUMCOLS - number of columns returned by last query
	ROW.* - list of all columns returned by last query. Both column names and
	  numbers are saved in the list, so you can use indexes [0..] or column
	  names [id, name, etc] here.
  DB Methods:
    CLOSE - disconnects the SQL server
    CONNECT - connects to the database (using mysql settings in sphere.ini)
	EXECUTE - executes SQL query not filling any results anywhere
	QUERY - executes SQL query filling ROW.* properties information
  Example of a simple query:
	DB.query "SELECT id FROM users WHERE account='<SRC.ACCOUNT.NAME>'"
	SERV.log "Got ID = <DB.ROW.id>"
  Note: Server does not create connection upon start, so if you wish to make
    the connection with the server start, add DB.connect to the function
	f_onserver_start.
- Fixed: Map support higher than map 0. Now there should be no more problems
  with fix throwing to incorrect Z level (hopefully).

31-07-05, Radiant
- Added: Support for tooltips. Requires OF_Tooltips (02000) and the 020
  FeaturesLogin flag. Usable in scripts:
  	Every object has a OBJPROPS property, which works like tags. Syntax:
  	OBJPROPS.<name>=<locale id>,[args]
  	note that <name> can be anything, but the entries are sent in alphabetical
  	order. So, for example, a bag, the props would look like this:

  	OBJPROPS.a="1048032"				// a bag
  	OBJPROPS.b="1050044,32,450" // ~1_COUNT~ items, ~2_WEIGHT~ stones
- Fixed: exception occuring during load with unknown keys in sphere.ini

01-08-05, Radiant
- Added: CTAG0 similar to TAG0 version of CTAG.

03-08-05, Radiant
- Horses are now forced to dismount and will die if someone is riding them and
  they have statf_dead set or their hitpoints are 0 or below.  This should fix
  the "ghost" horses appearing sometimes (when horse is poisoned and ridden).

08-08-05, Furio
- Fixed: CTAG0 when setting a value.
- Updated: sphere_backward_compatibility.scp
- Added: FILE obj, enabled by Of_File_Commands. Look in manual.txt for help.

08-08-05, Vjaka
- Added: SQL support for multiply rows. You can use both ways ROW.<column#> and
  ROW.<row#>.<column#> for addressing a field you are interested in, but the
  first method allows operating on row #0 only.
  Sample full-n-ready script to show how to use this feature:
	DB.connect
	if ( <DB.connected> )
		db.query "SELECT * FROM mytable"
		for R 0 <eval <DB.ROW.NUMROWS>-1>
			SERV.log "--- ROW #<eval <LOCAL.R>> ---"
			for C 0 <eval <DB.ROW.NUMCOLS>-1>
				SERV.log ".. COLUMN #<LOCAL.C> : <DB.ROW.<eval <LOCAL.R>>.<eval <LOCAL.C>>>"
			end
		end
	endif
- Added: a possibility to specify MySQL port. Just add ':port' to the host
  record.
- Fixed: account references in several cases leading to errors.

  to all accounts. Useful if all your clients are using at least some client.

  just add a horse item
- Script sphere_admin.scp:
  - Staff can see their own IP
  - Invisible staff is now printed in red
  - Added summon cage
- Fixed: problem in saves and allskills, no check if skill is defined or not.
  Broke saves (naked players) on some servers with not all skills (AOS and SE) defined.
- Fixed: Disconnected NPCs (horses) being seen if rider is gone (probably! need feedback)

18-08-05, Gygrazok (Script pack)
- Modified: sphere_admin.scp:

- Fixed: Spellbook with newer clients (displaying/selecting spell).
- Fixed: Elf NPCs from Mondain's Legacy (npcs/spherechar_mondains_legacy.scp)
- Updated: grayproto to support ML quest button.
- Updated: spheretables.scp (changed plevel of some commands for better security)

- Fixed: Players unavailable to call guards on NPCs.
- Fixed: Trigger command that did not work on characters.

25-08-05, Radiant
- Removed: OBJPROPS
- Rewritten tooltips to use a trigger. There is @ClientTooltip on items and characters.
  (in the world, only non-static, movable items)
  You can use ADDCLILOC on the client in this trigger (SRC), syntax:
  ADDCLILOC <cliloc id>,[arguments]
  Arguments can also be NULL, to skip an argument.
  If this trigger returns 0 or nothing, some default properties will be added to the tooltip
  depending on the type.
  If it returns 1, no default properties will be added (but the tooltip still be sent).
- Added: @GetTooltip (ARGO = item being sent for) for players. This is like @itemEquip, etc.
  Fired before @ClientTooltip, if returns 1 @ClientTooltip is skipped.
  Try keeping these triggers light, because they will be fired alot.
- Added: f_onserver_save_finished, called after save is completely done

  Note that in order for this setting to work the person you set this to has to be a full member
  of the guild.
- Fixed: REMOVE not working in @EquipTest
- Added: Encryption keys for clients are now in SphereCrypt.ini. When new clients come out,

03-09-2005, Furio
- Fixed: PARTY references (master/member)
- Fixed: hue/hair/beard for elf selectable on char creation
- Updated: sphere protocol (accepts tooltip refresh requests from new clients)
- Added: ISINPARTY to char (check if a player is in party)
- Added: UseDefaultSource (default: 0) if enabled SERV fallback to its default
  source when executing commands. You shold set this to 1 if you are operating
  with any new objects from functions called directly from the server, like
  f_onaccount_login, f_onserver_start and so on.

05-09-2005, Furio
- Updated: Sphere now support the internal client cache for tooltips. This will
  avoid wasting of bandwith and client crashes.

05-09-2005, Radiant
- Fixed: incorrect info on tooltips for some types

06-09-2005, Vjaka
- Fixed: some operations workability (SERV.new*) called from functions that are
  run directly by the server. This disables both the default script object and
  UseDefaultSource.
- Fixed: rescount-like operations when arguments was specifyed.
- Denied account auto-creation with first character numeric to avoid server
  confusion to treat this account as index or a valid name in some operations.
- Fixed: win32 server crash if server name was too long.

06-09-2005, Furio
- Added: SCREENSIZE to access the game window size if the client supports that.
  You can access that via SCREENSIZE.X and SCREENSIZE.Y.
- Added: RESENDTOOLTIP. Calling that on the object you need to resend tooltip.
  Since clients use a cache for tooltip, if you want to force the cache too use
  RESENDTOOLTIP 1.
- Fixed: REMOVEFROMVIEW/TARGET(FGW) not working.

08-09-2005, Vjaka
- Fixed: several errors with sql queries.
- Added: AutoPrivFlags to specify auto PRIV flags for new accounts.

- Added: TAG.NOSAVE tag for objects. If set to 1 the object will NOT be saved
  when the world save will take place.
- Fixed: NEW* commands on characters not modifying character's ACT.

08-09-2005, Furio
- Fixed: SCREENSIZE.X/.Y not working.
- Added: CLIENTIS3D. Returns 1 if is a client is 3D.
- Removed: Client support for clients older than 1.26.00 (they're awfully old).
- ReDone: Unencrypted client support. UseNoCrypt now is a bool 1 means that
  unencrypted client are allowed to login. If ClientVersion in sphere.ini is
  setted to some value (e.g. 4.0.0) then only that client version will login
  (this is valid for encrypted and unencrypted clients). Note that sometimes
  unencrypted clients sometimes are dumb and sphere not recognize them properly
  (and thus disconnected), but after restarting the client it's all ok.
- Modified: REPORTEDCLIVER. It contains the version of the unencrypted client
  without any trailing letter. To get the complete version (e.g 4.0.11f) use
  REPORTEDCLIVER.1.
- Modified: Disabled support for client tooltip cache (it'll be re-enabled after
  a re-write).

08-09-2005, Cloud_Br (Script pack)

09-09-2005, Vjaka
- Fixed: Popup menus not calling SELL, BUY speech triggers on NPCs.

- Fixed: mounting later npcs since they were treated being brain_human.

10-09-2005, Cloud_Br (Script pack)
- Fixed: some guarded areas on sphere_map2.scp that should be guarded.
- Fixed: names on sphere_map1.scp (Britain being Britain too, so when you

  "Trammel <local name>".
- Fixed: some errors on addons/worldfiles.zip.
- Added: new mounts on sphere_chars_new_mounts.scp and their icons.

  Attention is a 1 based field so... 1 means Alchemy and so on.
- Modified: now PACKETxx in .ini accept values from 0 to 255.
- Modified: item, with attr not containing 010 or 08000, dropped by player

  These functions are not saved, so do not store hours in the list, the purpose
  of this is to decrease overhead due to timered memory items opeations.

    0  - Normal speed.
    1  - Double speed on foot, normal speed when mounted.
    2  - Always walk on foot and when mounted.
    3+ - Always run on foot, always walk when mounted.

22-07-2006, coruja747 (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_map2.scp (Sorcerer Dungeon region definitions incorrect).

23-07-2006, Shadow Dragon
- Added: LOCAL.Arrow storing an UID of used arrow while archery in @Hit.
- Added: Extra combat flag COMBAT_PREHIT to allow pre hit combat style
  (first hit is instant)

26-07-2006, coruja747 (Script Pack)
- Updated: sphere_map2.scp (#793, Lake Shire region has not to be guarded)
- Added: GAINRADIUS keyword for skill definitions. Skillgain will only be calculated if
  the current skill is less than the actual difficulty + GAINRADIUS to prohibit skillgain
  by performing way too easy tasks. If not set it defaults to 100.0 (so pertaining the
  old behaviour)

27-07-2006, coruja747 (Script Pack)
- Fixed: #796, sphere_map_points2.scp (Wisp Dungeon, Kirin Passage, Cyclops Dungeon)

28-07-2006, coruja747 (Script Pack)
- Fixed: #800, missing teleports in sphere_map_points0.scp and sphere_map_points1.scp

29-07-2006, Nazghul
- Modified: @Dclick is now called for items which were dclicked by an NPC.
  (e.g. when an NPC is going to open a door, @DClick is called for this door)
- Fixed #798: If a wall was built on a spot where a paralyzed player stays,
  he was not unparalyzed.

29-07-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Vendors speak two messages when a player does not have any items to sell to them.

30-07-2006, Shadow Dragon
- Added: New trigger @Criminal called after someone becomes criminal for someone.
  [] - criminal, SRC - someone. RETURN 1 - stops hardcoded effect (memory_harmedby and so),
  so you can make your own criminal system.

31-07-2006, Kirofus (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_types.scp (Fixed incorrect terrain definition for t_water)

31-07-2006, MrSugarCube
- Modified: MaxWeight is now sent to the client for display on the status window in
  newer clients.

31-07-2006, Nazghul
- Added: CONTP function, which allows you to change the position of an item,
  which is inside a container.

01-08-2007, Nazghul
- Added: INI flag EF_New_Walkcheck = 04000 to switch on and off new walkcheck routines
  what should prohibit NPC from passing thru walls if not explicitely stated
  (CAN-Flag mt_passwalls (08))

02-08-2006, Furio
- Added: STRREGEX(pattern,string) that execute a pattern matching supporting the
  known standard. Return: 1 match found, 0 match not found, -1 illegal pattern syntax.

04-08-2006, Nazghul
(most code revised, debugged and (re)designed by Ellessar when I was up to drop
this all in desperation)
- Added: Function AddContextEntry. what takes 2 to 4 arguments separated by a comma.
   SRC.AddContextEntry EntryTag,TextID,Flags,Color
   EntryTag - the number to return as ARGN by @(item)ContextMenuSelect. Make it unique.
            - EntryTags from 0 to 100 are reserved by Sphere for internal use, so do not
              use it.
   TextID - CLILOCed name of the button. The number from cliloc.[your_localization]
            WITHOUT the leading "300" or such! Just type "5194" or "11010"
   Flags - 01 - locked (will be grayed out)
         - 02 - consecutive entries with this flag set will be summarized under
                a golden arrow
         - 020 - can be colored
   Color (applied only if Flags & 020) - hue

- Added: Trigger @ContextMenuRequest/@itemContextMenuRequest which is fired after
  receiving a display Popup-menu client request (single click on an object).

  It can be fired two times, each call has a different ARGN.

  The first time it is fired before any hardcoded stuff is added to the Popup-menu.
  Here, Return 1 denies displaying any hardcoded entries, but if you make a softcoded
  entry, it WILL be displayed. It also will prohibit the second call of the trigger.
  Both, Return 0 and Return 2 allows hardcoded stuff to be added. If you change ARGN,
  the trigger will be called once more (but ARGN != 1).

  The second time it is fired after all hardcoded stuff was added (so you can add
  your stuff to the bottom of the Popup-menu). Return value has no effect at all.

  The first call:
   In:  ARGN = 1
   Out: Return 1 - only your stuff will be added (IF ANY), prohibits the second call
        Return 0/2 - your and hardcoded stuff will be added
        ARGN (ARGN != 1) - allows the second call

  The second call:
   In:  ARGN = 2
   Out: Return 0/1/2 - does nothing
        ARGN - does nothing

- Added: Trigger @ContextMenuSelect/@itemContextMenuSelect which is fired after
  a client selects something from a Popup-menu. ARGN is a value, which was sent
  by the server to the client as the first argument with the AddContextEntry function.

06-08-2006, MrSugarCube
- Modified: SERV.ACCOUNT.x now returns 1 if the account name or index exists, or 0 if not.
- Added: P.STATICS.x.COLOR and P.STATICS.x.Z can be used to find the colour and height
  of static items.
- Modified: Setting BONUS_STATS to 0 in SKILL definitions disables using BONUS_x properties
  when calculating stat gains for that skill instead of blocking all stat gains for it. If
  you want to prevent stat gains, you should either set STAT_x to 0, or set BONUS_x to 0
  with BONUS_STATS greater than 0.

07-08-2006, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_msgs.scp (Fixed some 'broken' defmessages with tabs in)

10-08-2006, ShiryuX (Script Pack)
- Fixed: #827 Kirin entered twice in sphere_defs.scp

14-08-2006, Nazghul
- Added: dmgcold, dmgenergy, dmgfire, dmgpoison properties for weapons with no built-in
  functionality (yet).
- Fixed: Returned maxweight property different from maxweight property displayed
  in status gump.
- Fixed #592: Wrong spellbook packets send by Linux versions
- Updated: sphere.ini - added new experimental flag EF_NewPositionChecks.

16-08-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Experimental flag EF_NewPositionChecks, with this flag on,
  the new position-related checks behavior will be used. So far it does something only
  with resource gathering related skills (lumberjacking, mining, fishing, eating grass etc.)
  and Advanced LOS.
  The flag is HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL!
- Modified: FORPLAYERS now loops through logouted players. If you want to loop only through
  online players, use FORCLIENTS.

17-08-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Retrieving StatLock properties with STATLOCK[statname] and SKILLLOCK[skillname]
- Fixed #835: Setting StatLocks on the status window sets the incorrect StatLock[x] property.
- Modified: Undefined region warnings are no longer reported for locations outside of the
  map boundaries.

20-08-2006, Nazghul (Changes only for servers with EF_NewPositionCheck on)
- Fixed #304: NPCs are dumber in pathfinding with EF_DiagonalWalkCheck on
  (fixed only with EF_NewPositionCheck and EF_WalkCheck on).
- Fixed #747, #767: Z not updated when you enter a multi, .fix not working inside a multi.
- Fixed #837, #829: NPCs not spawning (or on the wrong place) inside a building.
- Fixed #598: Ladders not updating Z and a player cannot step on some of them.
- Modified GOTO function: NPC will now not stop moving after the first step.

26-08-2006, Nazghul (Changes only for servers with EF_NewPositionCheck on)
- Fixed #744: Line Of Sight check going from out of a house into the house was successful,
  but not vice versa.
- Fixed: Item flags and height was always inherited from the parent item
  (the item with DUPELIST=), what damaged almost all Line Of Sight checks.

28-08-2006, Nazghul (Changes only for servers with EF_NewPositionCheck on)
- Modified: Now, archery, potion throwing, dragon breathing, stone throwing, magery can be
  used through a window.
- Modified: Now, fishing use LOS and prohibits casting through blocking objects.

28-08-2006, Nazghul
- Updated sphere_defs.scp: Added DEFNAME los_flags.
- Updated sphere_msgs.scp: Added message fishing_los.
- Removed: Multithreading support for Linux version due to its unusability on this OS.

30-08-2006, Nazghul
- MODIFIED: RESCOLD, RESENERGY, RESFIRE, RESPOISON now can also be set on NPC
  Remember that RES*=100 will give you a 100 percent immunity against the damage inflicted
  by TAG.*DAMAGE.
- Added: COMBAT_SPECIALDAMAGE to INI CombatFlags (08). If set, TAG.*DAMAGE (below) will be
  used.
- Added: COMBAT_USE_RESISTANCE to INI CombatFlags (010). If set, RES* on characters will
  also be weighted against normal damage if the old fashioned damage flags are set.
- Added: TAG.COLDDAMAGE, TAG.ENERGYDAMAGE, TAG.FIREDAMAGE, TAG.POISONDAMAGE for characters
  and items. The server will only evaluate the tags on characters, and if ComBatFlag
  COMBAT_SPECIALDAMAGE is set. Then any damage done to others (if it's damage type contains
  at least one of the physical types OR magic) will be increased by the value of the
  appropriate tag, lowered by the RES* percentage of the victim.
  Tags on items will not be evaluated by the server - their values can be used to for
  example increase the TAGs or the RES* properties on characters on equip of the item.
  This way you can use TAG.*DAMAGE on a weapon to increase the wearer's appropriate
  damage tag, or on a piece of armor to increase his RES*, or to whatever you want.

31-08-2006, Nazghul
- Added: NPC trigger @PetDesert. Fires when a pet decides to go wild.
  Default object is the pet, SRC the master. RETURN 1 changes the pet's mind.

31-08-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: P.REGION reference not working correctly in areas defined via ROOMDEFs.
- Added: P.ROOM can be used to access the ROOM properties of a point, just like
  you can with P.REGION.
- Modified: P.REGION and P.ROOM now return 0 if a region or room doesn't exist at
  the point, and 1 if one does.
- Added: Support for the new BandageSelf and BandageTarget macros found in the
  latest clients (5.0.4). Using the macro will act as if the client has just
  targeted something with the bandage (and so @[item]TargOn_Item will be called).

01-09-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #849: Enabling precasting does not freeze characters when casting.
- Fixed #849: With precasting enabled, skill is gained before the spell is
  completely cast at a target.
- Fixed #849: Harmful area effect spells don't affect the caster when
  MAGICF_CANHARMSELF is enabled.
- Fixed #849: TELE and POLY functions not working correctly with precasting
  enabled.
- Fixed #849: Casting from spellbook not working correctly with both
  FEATURE_AOS_UPDATE_B and MAGICF_PRECAST settings enabled.
- Fixed: Exception caused by spell effects on items with no SRC present.

02-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: TAG.OVERRIDE.MOVERATE for NPC to speed up or slow down single NPC

05-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Option flag OF_Buffs. When on, Sphere will automatically add and remove buff and
  debuff icons to the affected players.
- Updated: sphere.ini - added new optional flag OF_Buffs
- Added: Functions ADDBUFF, REMOVEBUFF for adding and removing buff/debuff icons.
  syntax: ADDBUFF IconId ClilocOne ClilocTwo Seconds Text1 Text2(optional) Text3(optional)
          The text fields are supposed to hold max. 3 characters each (numbers) and will
          be cut off if larger.
  	  REMOVEBUFF IconId
  These functions only work with client 5.0.3 or above.

06-09-2006, Nazghul (script pack)
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp (added defnames for buff icons and clilocs)
- Fixed: bug with i_multi_tower_wizard - the door was placed BELOW the floor,
  so unuseable with new LOS checks

07-09-2006, Nazghul
- Updated: sphere.ini - added new debug flags DEBUGF_SCRIPTS, DEBUGF_LOS.

10-09-2006, ShiryuX (Script Pack)
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp - added a defname for rideable Polar Bear

11-09-2006, Nazghul
- Fixed #852: Trigger @SKILLSUCCESS did not fire with fighting skills

12-09-2006, MrSugarCube
- Added: FORINSTANCES to loop through all instances of a given BaseID. Usage
  is "FORINSTANCES id". If an ID is not supplied then the BaseID of the default
  object will be used. Works for both items and characters.

12-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: A new item property IsCont, which returns 1 if an item is a container and 0 if
  it is not.
- Updated: sphere.ini - added a new debug flag DEBUGF_WALK.

15-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: INI Flag OF_NoPrefix (0x4000) to get rid of the "A" and "An" prefixes what ere
  only an annoyance for not english language shards
- Changed: Key links will only be blanked if they are pointing to an invalid item UID now.
  Before everything what was neither container nor multi was considered "invalid", so keys
  with the UID of a door, or themselves could turn blank.
- Added #848: Character trigger @SpellSelect. Doing pretty much the same as the spell trigger
  @select and has the same arguments/parameters
- Fixed #778: Wrong spellbook recognition with more than one spellbook std., necro, ...)
  in pack.
- Updated: sphere.ini - Removed experimental flag EF_New_Walkcheck.

16-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: OF_DyeType flag to sphere.ini. If set players are allowed to use i_dye on every
  t_dye_vat instead of only i_dye_tub. Making it switcheable for all those who have concerns
  about exploitability (even as I do not see any risk) - we all remember the times when
  injection users colored whole shards pink.

17-09-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Using Bandage macro with a target prompt already present calling @TargOn_Cancel
  on the bandages.
- Fixed #863: Changing RESFIRE/RESENERGY/RESPOISON/RESCOLD properties does not update the
  client.
- Fixed: Unable to gain magery skill with precasting enabled.
- Fixed: Various object references not accessible from the guildstone object.
- Fixed #865: GUILD.MEMBER.x.ISMEMBER property not working correctly.

20-09-2006, Nazghul
- Fixed #853: Update & DClick stopped display of weather effects

21-09-2006, Nazghul
- added TAG.OVERRIDE.AMMOTYPE and TAG.OVERRIDE.AMMOANIM for bows and xbows to - yes, OVERRIDE the
  TDATA3 and TDATA4 values on a per-item-base

21-09-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #875: Exception caused by setting MASTERUID when no current guild/town master
  exists.
- Modified: Setting MASTERUID to the same uid as the current guild/town master no longer
  causes an error.
- Fixed: Calling the TRAIN function on an NPC in combat would cause an error.
- Modified #869: The TRAIN function now works on all NPC brains between 2 and 9.

21-09-2006, Nazghul
- changed GAINRADIUS so that it no longer defaults to anything - if not set on a skill
  it's just transparent (as if never invented)

22-09-2006, Nazghul
- Fixed #846: Bad character DispID displayed if there was serv.chardef called no NPC
  in the world with this ID.

24-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Function CONTCONSUME <arg1> <arg2>, which consumes <arg2> amount of an item with id <arg1>
  from a referenced container and its subcontainers. Function does nothing on chars (use consume)
  and on non-container items.
  Example: findlayer.29.contconsume i_gold 100000
- Added: Item trigger @Buy and character trigger @itemBuy, which are called before item is sold
  by a vendor. The trigger is called only with EF_New_Triggers on.
  ACT/DEFAULT is the item, SRC is the player, ARGN is the item amount, ARGO is the vendor.
  Return 1 prevents the player from buying the item.
- Added: Item trigger @Sell and character trigger @itemSell, which are called before item is bought
  by a vendor. The trigger is called only with EF_New_Triggers on.
  ACT/DEFAULT is the item, SRC is the player, ARGN is the item amount, ARGO is the vendor.
  Return 1 prevents the player from selling the item.
- Fixed: Serv.itemdef.xxx.skill not always returning the skill
- Fixed: A copy & paste error in TAG.OVERRIDE.AMMO* what prevented the animation stuff to run.

25-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: EF_DamageTool (0x2000) to Sphere.ini. Only if set tools/weapons will be damaged while
  lumberjacking/mining (what includes firing @Damage on them)
- Fixed: NPCs spawning with incorrect Z position.

26-09-2006, Nazghul
- Modified: @(item)ContextMenuRequest and @(item)ContextMenuSelect now will not be called with
  EF_Minimize_Triggers on.

27-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: TDATA3 and TDATA4 of a container type item are now holding min and max coordinates of
  the "area were items may be placed", relatively to the open container gump.
  TDATA3 is (MinX * 0x10000) + MinY, TDATA4 is (MaxX * 0x10000) + MaxY
  Be very careful with these settings - if they are set to illegal values (i.e., outside of the
  visible gump) Sphere will happily accept them, but your users will not be able to pick items
  placed there out of the container, because the client will only display then if they have the
  container gump as a background!
  If TDATA4 is not set (or set to 0), default values will apply, along with the console warning
  "unknown gump id".

28-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: MOREM value (0..127) on digestible food will override the amount of "food units"
  what will be added to the characters FOOD property when eating this. Obviously, items
  with different MOREM will not stack. Because on=@SUCCESS on cooking will not give you
  a reference to the newly created item but only to the raw one, MOREM will be transferred
  from the raw food (what you may alter in on=@success)

29-09-2006, Nazghul
- Added: 3 defmessages, thus making the headline for the "c" console command configurable.

01-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Intrinsic function IsObscene what tests whether the passed argument is a forbidden
  word (list of these words are in your spheretables.scp under the section OBSCENE).
- Fixed: Obscene not matching obscened words inside a string.
- Fixed #889: Fame.* and Karma.* always returning 0.
- Updated: spheretables.scp - added KARMA and FAME sections. Now you can change, add or remove
  keys which are used behind Karma. and Fame. . First line declares steps, other lines their
  names.
  IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO UPDATE YOUR SPHERETABLES.SCP!!!

02-10-2006, Nazghul (Script Pack)
- Fixed #867: sphere_minor_artifacts.scp, i_orcish_visage
- Updated: Flags notification on server startup

02-10-2006, Nazghul
- Fixed #898: Some stairs unwalkable with EF_NewPositionChecks, EF_WalkCheck and
  EF_DiagonalWalkCheck on.

05-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: INI flag OF_OSIDamageMod (0x04)
  Modifying weapon damage OSI style, according to this formulas (originally provided by ClouD_Br):
  Tactics Damage Bonus% = Tactics � 1.6 (Add 6.25% if Tactics >= 100)
  Anatomy Damage Bonus% = (Anatomy � 2) + 5
  Lumberjack Damage Bonus% = Lumberjack � 2 (Add 10% if Lumberjacking >= 100)
  Strength Damage Bonus% = Strength * 0.3 (Add 5% if Strength >= 100)
  Final Damage Bonus% = Tactics Bonus + Anatomy Bonus + Lumber Bonus + Strangth Bonus + Damage Increase Items*
  Final Damage = Base Damage + (Base Damage * Final Damage Bonus%)
  * Damage Increase is capped at 100%.

05-10-2006, Nazghul
- Fixed #036: Fixed TRY and TRYSRV not working with locals (local and arg*). TRYSRC and TRYP
  do not work, since it makes no sense to use it on local variables. (Thx to Ellessar who
  finally worked out how this SHOULD work, so we found the bug deeply buried under tons of
  old code)

06-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Function ISNEARTYPETOP(.P) which uses new checks for resource gathering (item which
  you want to find must be at the top, if at the top there are 2 items, then the success
  depends on the priority (dynamic->multi->static->terrain) of those items). Syntax is the
  same with ISNEARTYPE(.P). NOTE: This function is called from hardcode if EF_NewPositionChecks
  are on.
- Fixed #668: Delete packets of items which cannot be seen were sent to the client.
- Modified #632: Now, IsPlayer can be used on every game object.
- Modified: sphere.ini - added an NPC AI flag NPC_AI_INTFOOD which enables smarter and more
  trustworthy food finding.

08-10-2006, Furio
- Modified: TRIGGER command. It now supports calling a trigger with arguments, the syntax is:
  TRIGGER $trigger_name[,$trigger_arg_type,...] where $trigger_arg_type can be:
  - TAT_AS_ARGN (1): uses arguments as ARGN. Example: TRIGGER @MyTest,<def.TAT_AS_ARGN>,1,2,3
                     will call @MyTest with ARGN1=1 ARGN2=2 ARGN3=3.
  - TAT_AS_ARGS (2): uses arguments as ARGS. Example: TRIGGER @MyTest,<def.TAT_AS_ARGS>,hi you 2,yo !
                     will call @MyTest with ARGS=hi you 2,yo !.
  - TAT_AS_ARGO (3): uses arguments as ARGN. Example: TRIGGER @MyTest,<def.TAT_AS_ARGO>,01
                     will call @MyTest with ARGO.UID=01 (only if object with such uid exist).
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp (with new definitions for the TRIGGER command).
- Fixed #880: Explode function not working as it should.

09-10-2006, Nazghul
- fixed problems with spellbooks obviously triggered by new Gcc compiler for Linux with a weird
  workaround.

10-10-2006, Nazghul
- Fixed #900: Added INI flag COMBAT_DCLICKSELF_UNMOUNT to unmount horse when dclicking self
  while in warmode.

11-10-2006, Nazghul (Script Pack)
- Updated: sphere_msgs.scp - more defmessages to customize text output.
- Updated (#905): sphere_item_provisions_potions.scp - Shrink potion did not behave as expected.

13-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Intrinsic functions SIN() and COS(). Attention: Without FLOAT math they will obviously
  only return 0 and 1 :)

16-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Support for floats (local variables FLOAT.younameit, which have size of double, and
  can hold precise numbers). Usage of these variables is the same like LOCAL.younameit. As
  EVAL only uses integer arithmetic, with FLOAT math you have to use <FLOATVAL ()>
  (New code was done mainly by Ellessar and Decrythe, I just "glued" it into Sphere :) )
- Changed: Return values for @SPELLSELECT trigger. Touchup for @SELECT with spells. Different
  server behaviour can be achieved with the following RETURN values in trigger scripts:
  @SELECT
  	RETURN 0 - proceed without mana, spellbook, and reagent check as if these checks were
  						 successful
		RETURN 1 - Abort processing (so aborting the spell)
	  RETURN 2 - proceed as normal
	  RETURN 6 - like RETURN 0 (for compatibility with @SPELLSELECT)
  @SPELLSELECT
  	RETURN 0 - proceed as normal
		RETURN 1 - abort processing (so aborting the spell)
	  RETURN 2 - proceed as normal
	  RETURN 6 - proceed without mana, spellbook, and reagent check as if these checks were
	  					 successful
  @SPELLSELECT will be called after @SELECT - what means, if you leave @SELECT with RETURN 0 or
  RETURN 1, @SPELLSELECT will NOT be called!

16-10-2006, Furio
- Added: DAM.HI/LO and ARMOR.HI/LO

17-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Defmessage if skillgain is aborted due to GAINRADIUS not met; message will only be displayed
  if TAG.NOSKILLMSG=1 on character
- Fixed: Problems with long passwords and MD5 hash on.

18-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added INI flag OF_DrinkIsFood (0x10000). If set, T_DRINK will increase FOOD lvl. like T_FOOD

19-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Dynamic property "height" for characters.

20-10-2006, Nazghul
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp - added defname charheight.

21-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: New "m" paramter for TARGET function. Now you can use TARGETM and TARGETFM for targeting
  a place for your multi (you will see your multi in the "ghost mode"). TARGETM takes as an argument
  ONLY ID of the multi, TARGETFM takes 2 arguments - function_to_call,ID_ot_the_multi.

21-10-2006, Nazghul (Changes only for servers with EF_NewPositionCheck on and AdvancedLOS on)
- Modified: CanSeeLOS now uses height of a character for its checks. Height is read in this order
  and first correct entry is used:
  1. Dynamic height property of an object
  2. Height property under CHARDEF/ITEMDEF (can be inherited)
  3. Defname in format "height_dispid", while dispid is a hex number in Sphere format (0a3)
  4. Defname in format "height_dispid", while dispid is a dec number
  5. Universal height - "15"
  If a character is mounted, its height is raised by 4. CanSeeLOS reduce height of an unmounted
  character by 1 (pretending eyes height).
  NOTE: This formula is used when you are doing .show height, or <height> in scripts.

23-10-2006, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Webpage requests always displaying the "Internal Server Error" page.

24-10-2006, Nazghul
- Added: Trigger @(item)Buy now has local.totalcost, which holds the cost of the whole purchase
  and ARGN2, which holds price of this amount of items (price * amount).
- Fixed: Trigger @(item)Buy returning bad amount in ARGN1.
- Added: Local variables LOCAL.CREATEOBJECT1 and LOCAL.CREATEOBJECT2 to @SUCCESS trigger of spells.
  These variables are _unset_ when the trigger is called. But they can be _set_ with field- and
  summon spells to change what these spells will create.
  - Summon spells (summon creature, bladeSpirit, Vortex, summon daemon, summon *elemental) take only
    the first one. If set with LOCAL.CREATEOBJECT1 = <eval c_orc> the spell will summon an orc. This
    way one can add more random daemons to the summon daemon spell, or change the spawned creature
    due to magery or whatever.
  - field spells (s_wall_of_stone, s_fire_field etc) take both variables, as usually the items for
    the field in west-east direction are different from those in north-south direction. If necessary
    they can of course be the same (s_fire_field looks impressive with i_fire_columns :) ), but BOTH
    have to be set (otherwise the unset will be replaced by the spell's default item for this dir).
    Example:
    [SPELL s_fire_field]
    ...
    on=@SUCCESS
      IF <magery> >= 99.9
        LOCAL.CREATEOBJECT1 = <eval i_fire_column>
        LOCAL.CREATEOBJECT2 = <eval i_fire_column>
      ENDIF

- Modified: EFFECT property of crafting skills can now be used to define the percentage of resources
  that are lost when failing to craft an item. A few examples of how you can use this:
   "EFFECT=x"		- Always lose x% of resources on fail
   "EFFECT=x,y"		- Lose between x% and y% of resources on fail
   "EFFECT=x,y,z"	- Lose between x% and z% of resources on fail (weighted by y)
  If EFFECT is not set then resource loss will be as normal -> 0-50% resources lost.

- Fixed #1004: Target cursor appearing when calling functions starting with "SET" or "X".
- Added #1013: SYSMESSAGELOC, for sending localized messages to clients. SMSGL can also be used as a shortcut.
  Syntax is: "SYSMESSAGELOC color,clilocid[,arguments]"
  All arguments must be separated by a comma ",". Specify -1 for color if you do not wish to override it.
  Some examples of this being used (latest clilocs) are:
   "SYSMESSAGELOC -1,502771"			- Displays "You cannot reach that."
   "SYSMESSAGELOC 2,1042758,MrSugarCube"	- Displays "You are now loyal to MrSugarCube." in blue
   "SYSMESSAGELOC -1,1062695,MrSugarCube,4,5"	- Displays "MrSugarCube rolls the dice and gets a 4 and
						  a 5!"
- Modified #1013: '@color,font,unicode' in messages is now '@color,font,mode'. You can specify 1 for mode if
  you wish to use unicode (like before), or specify 2 if you wish to use a localized message (useful for
  overriding messages in sphere_msgs.scp). The above localization examples used with this method would be:
   "SYSMESSAGE @,,2 502771"
   "SYSMESSAGE @2,,2 1042758,MrSugarCube"
   "SYSMESSAGE @,,2 1062695,MrSugarCube,4,5"

  on a dclicked item won't be performed.

  checks on a dclicked item won't be performed.

16-01-2007, MrSugarCube
- Added #1029: @Cancel trigger to MENUs and SKILLMENUs.
- Modified: Items displayed on MENUs and SKILLMENUs can now be coloured. This can be done by prefixing the
  item description with "@color" (in the same way that sysmessages can be coloured). For example,
  "ON=i_sword_viking @2 This is a viking sword" will display a blue sword on the menu.
- Modified: Cancelling a PROMPTCONSOLE prompt no longer prevents the callback function from being called.

19-07-2007, MrSugarCube
- Added: Support for packet changes in client 6.0.1.7. With clients running
  on slower connections there may still be issues as Sphere cannot identify
  the 4th digit of the client version until after the client has logged in.
  If you want to override all 6.0.1.* clients to use the 6.0.1.7 packet
  changes (and thus correct the issue with slower connections, but at the
  same time remove support for 6.0.1.0-6 clients), find the following line
  in sphereCrypt.ini:
    0600010 02F2BA7ED 0A2817E7F ENC_TFISH // 6.00.10
  and change it to:
    0600018 02F2BA7ED 0A2817E7F ENC_TFISH // 6.00.18
- Added: FIXWEIGHT function for characters, which acts the same as FIXWEIGHT
  does on containers (recalculates the total weight of the items in their
  possession).

   spheremultis.scp.
 > Note that Sphere will require access to doors.txt, misc.txt, floors.txt,

                            ARGN1:    Is set to 1 if the character being forced
                                      out of house design mode (ie. they're
                                      logging out).
                            ARGO:     The building being designed.
                            RETURN 1: Keeps the client in design mode (if ARGN1
                                      was 0).

  example, Begging), so make sure the SKF_MAGIC flag is set on such skills.
  
14-12-2007, coruja747 (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_item_building_walls_se.scp (Missing item 02753)

- Updated: sphere_map_points2.scp (Inaccessible teleports on Exodus Dungeon)

21-12-2007, MrSugarCube
- Modified: Ships now move 2 spaces at a time instead of 1. This reduces a lot
  of lag caused by ship movement and also fixes overhead messages disappearing
  whilst the ship is in motion.
- Added: SHIPSPEED property to ship ITEMDEFs. This controls how often and how far
  the ship will move. SHIPSPEED.PERIOD and SHIPSPEED.TILES can be used to return
  the separate values. Usage:
    "SHIPSPEED=5,3"     Ship will move 3 tiles every half a second.
    "SHIPSPEED=1,5"     Ship will move 5 tiles every tenth of a second.
    "SHIPSPEED=20,2"    Ship will move 2 tiles every 2 seconds.
  Note 1: If there is less space available than specified by SHIPSPEED.TILES,
  the ship will still move as far as possible before stopping (so if a ship is
  set to move 10 tiles and is heading towards a coast that is 16 tiles away, the
  ship will move 10 tiles, then 6 tiles, and then stop.
  Note 2: TAG.OVERRIDE.SHIPSPEED.PERIOD and TAG.OVERRIDE.SHIPSPEED.TILES can also
  be set on the ships themselves to override their speed on an individual basis.

22-12-2007, Nazghul
- Added: Triggers @NPCAction and @NPCSpecialAction
  @NPCSpecialAction
  If the NPC has a lot of spare time (i.e., nothing else to do) it
  looks for some special action. For example, giant spiders lay webs,
  and fire elems leave fire patches. This trigger fires on ANY type
  of creature. If you return 1, it will not do it's special action,
  on return 0 it will (what, as said above, will only be true with
  giant spiders and fire elems; you can script other NPC special
  events yourself).

  @NPCAction
  AI-related trigger. If the situation is so the NPC will do something
  due to it's AI - things like animals pooping the ground, vendors
  going off/on duty, (un)equipping a lightsource when it's dark, 
  (un)equipping a weapon when fighting, stabler feeding animals or
  giving players food for their animals etc. - (once hardcoded behaviour
  was planned also for beggars who should sleep at night, for thieves,
  undead mages, healers, and more, but never realized. Now you can script
  this yourself) this trigger will be fired. On RETURN 0 
  the NPC will continue with what it wants to do, RETURN 1 will abort it.

  Both triggers will fire only if EF_NPCAct_Triggers is SET and 
  EF_Minimize_Triggers is NOT SET in the sphere.INI. SO if you don't
  change your INI, everything will stay as it was before.

22-12-2007, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1341: Arguments not being parsed correctly for commands entered
  on the console.

  space in them (ie. TAG.xxx_<EVAL yyy> = zzz).

04-01-2008, Nazghul
- Added: Triggers @Mount and @Dismount, both are character trigger, firing 
	when a character tries to mount/dismout it's ride (and will be able to).
  @DISMOUNT
    ARGO is the UID of the (still disconnected!) pet.
    RETURN 1 stops the dismount process.
  @MOUNT
    ARGO is the UID of the NPC bound to be ridden.
    RETURN 1 stops the mounting process.

  scroll, etc).
- Fixed: CALL not working with object references. (eg. "CALL src.myfunction")
- Fixed: ++/-- in scripts being parsed as +=1 when not being used as operators.

- Added: SERV.MAPLIST.$mapid.$prop to cycle through maps to get props. The list of
  properties that can be accessed (read only) are:
  BOUND.X = maximum x for the map
	BOUND.Y = maximum y for the map
	CENTER.X = x coord of map center
  CENTER.Y = y coord of map center
	SECTOR.SIZE = size of sectors
	SECTOR.ROWS = qty of sector rows for the map
  SECTOR.COLS = qty of sector columns for the map
  SECTOR.QTY = total number of sectors for the map
- Added: FeatureKR and Kr reslevel (6). Guess what they do (it's a wip).
- Added: EF_UseNetworkMulti (00800000) to experimental flags. Tired of crashing due
  too many items/npcs, try it. Don't change it while the server is running.
  (Thx to Z. for the windows version)

21-01-2008, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1311: NPC Pathfinding failing when EF_DiagonalWalkCheck is enabled.

- Added DIALOGLIST keyword. DIALOGLIST.COUNT gives the number of open gump dialogs,
  DIALOGLIST.$x.ID ($x = a number between 0 and DIALOGLIST.COUNT-1) the ID of the
  respective gump dialog, and DIALOGLIST.$x.COUNT the number of active instances of
  this dialog. So to close a specified gump, DIALOGCLOSE <DIALOGLIST.$n.ID> should do.
- Added KRTOOLBARSTATUS (prop/verb) and @UserKRToolbar (ARGN1 type, ARGN2 arg) to
  interact with the hotbar in the KR client.

03-02-2008, Shadow Dragon
- added @KarmaChange, @FameChange. Called when Karma/Fame adjusting.
  ARGN1 = Karma/Fame modifier, it's writable.
  return 0 will use Argn1 value in adjusting.
  return 1 will break adjusting.
  return 2 will ignore Argn1 and continue default adjusting.
  Both triggers work only when EF_Minimize_Triggers isn't set.

28-04-2008, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1394: Advanced pathfinding (NPC_AI_PATH) allowing NPCs to make invalid movements
  (for example walking whilst paralyzed). Some other adjustments have also been made,
  allowing NPCs to properly assess characters that may be blocking the way (to walk around
  them), negotiate corners with EF_DiagonalWalkCheck enabled, and attempt to compensate
  when new obstacles block a previously valid path.
- Fixed #1390: Locals not working in SKILLMENUs.

28-04-2008, coruja747 (Script pack)
- Updated #1392: spherechar_new_mounts.scp, spherechar_mondains_legacy.scp (Updated
  RESDISPDNHUE property on rides)

02-05-2008, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1348: Problem where <SERV.ResourceType.Id> returns 1 when the id is a different
  resource type (e.g. <SERV.TEMPLATE.i_dagger> (dagger being an item not a template)).

15-05-2008, Shadow Dragon
- Added LAYER_AUCTION that can contain container on character for script purposes, like
  auction system.

19-05-2008, Shadow Dragon
- Modified: GOLD property adds new gold stacks to bankbox.

21-05-2008, Nazghul 
- Added: Combat flags to Sphere.ini to allow stacking armor and aimed hits. Example of usage
  is in scripts/AddOns. 
  Aimed hits are controlled by tags on the "hitter": TAG.HITPREFERENCE holds the targetted
  zone: 1=head, 2=neck/throat, 3=back, 4=chest, 5=arms, 6=hands, 7=legs, 8=feet (if the value
  is out of this range it will be changed by %9; "0" means: no preference set);
  TAG.HITPREFERENCE_CHANCE (0..1000) is the chance to really hit the desired area;
  TAG.HITPREFERENCE.BONUS is the percent the damage is raised when hit where desired,
  TAG.HITPREFERENCE.PENALTY is the percent the damage is lowered if the area was missed.
  The last two values are defaulting to "30".
  The system is perhaps useful to script a system where a player can look for weak armored
  bodyparts of his opponent and try to hit him there; could be essential if armor stacking
  is used.

23-05-2008, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1418: Tracking being used to reveal the location of invisible staff members.
- Fixed #1417: Unable to access account properties using [SERV.]ACCOUNT.x.KEY where account
  x begins with a number.

- Fixed: Variety of exceptions caused when items are being set to type t_eq_memory_obj after
  after creation.
- Modified: RESTOCK function on vendors now accepts a parameter to specify whether or not
  new stock should be spawned immediately (0=empty existing stock (default), 1=empty stock
  and spawn next set).

26-05-2008, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Code not being skipped properly when incorrect loop syntax is used.
- Modified: @UserVirtue trigger now has 2 arguments:
   ARGO  = The character whose virtue button has been pressed
   ARGN1 = The button ID pressed (1=virtue button (on paperdoll), 105-112=icons within the
           menu)
           Note: Clients only specify the character they're viewing (ARGO) when pressing the
           paperdoll button (ARGN1=1)
- Added: @UserVirtueInvoke trigger, called when a virtue is invoked through client macros.
   ARGN1 = The virtue ID (1=Honor, 2=Sacrifice, 3=Valor)

15-07-2008, Beyonder
- Added: Extra local arguments to @SkillStart and @Start (skill section) triggers for crafting 
  skills:
  LOCAL.CRAFTITEMDEF - the UID of defname of the item we are currently crafting. Readable/Writable.
  Accepts ONLY UIDs of ITEMDEFs, for example:

		LOCAL.CRAFTITEMDEF = <DEF.i_sword_long>
	endif
  LOCAL.CRAFTSTROKECNT - amount of strokes character makes while creating the item. Each stroke

- Modified: @Destroy on items and characters is triggered before deletion, not after. This way

  uncommitted changes that have been made to the building design.

03-09-2008, Nazghul
- Added #1504: Optional second parameter "amount" to MAKEITEM. Please understand that the
  "additional" items crafted will neither fire any trigger, nor give experience or skill. So,
  from that point of view there's no difference between "MAKEITEM i_dagger" and "MAKEITEM i_dagger,10"
  (except for the number of daggers created). If the resources you have are insufficiant for
  the amount, it will be shortened respectively.

08-09-2008, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1514: Players and NPCs unable to cast spells.
- Fixed #1508: Dropped items stacking regardless of their difference in height.

  information for the components specified in the mul files, and when accessing
  individual components (BASECOMPONENT.n.[ID/DX/DY/DZ/D] there is an additional "VISIBLE"
  property which returns 0 if the component is invisible (usually applies to doors and signs).

16-09-2008, Nazghul
- Added: Override Tags for item/action related sound.
  TAG.OVERRIDE.DOORSOUND_CLOSE / TAG.OVERRIDE.DOORSOUND_OPEN 
    (what it does should be obvious)
  TAG.OVERRIDE.PORTCULISSOUND - holds an sfx number played when 
    opening/closing a portculis
  TAG.OVERRIDE.DROPSOUND - sfx an items makes when dropped. Att:
    system default sounds sometimes change due to the amount dropped
    (gold, ingots), or on what surface/item the item is dropped. All
    this will be overridden!
  TAG.OVERRIDE.SOUND_HIT - on weapons holds the sound when it hits,
    regardless of WHAT it hits!
  TAG.OVERRIDE.SOUND_MISS - on weapons, sound they make when missing

  all TAGs need to hold a number (defname MAY be possible -> test!),
  what also can be "0" (zero) with the meaning: don't play any sound.


17-09-2008, Nazghul
- Added: Trigger @PICKUP_STACK what fires only if an item was picked up from a pile.
  ARGO is the remaining part of the stack. (There's a char trigger itemPICKUP_STACK
  also)

  rides. Note that this flag is not required for the bodies that could already mount rides prior
  to this flag's existence (c_man/c_woman/c_man_gm/c_elf_man/c_elf_woman). Also be aware that not
  all character bodies are intended to be used for mounting rides and won't have proper riding
  animations.

29-11-2008, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp (Added mt_mount to the can_flags defname section)

07-12-2008, MrSugarCube
- Added #1086: Skill degradation for skills that have been set to decrease. @SkillChange trigger
  is called for decaying skills just as it does when they gain (compare <ARGN2> to <<ARGN1>> to
  determine if the skill is being increased or lowered).
- Added: Experimental flag EF_UseNetworkMultiVersionMod. This modifies the behaviour of the
  EF_UseNetworkMulti flag (don't forget to set this too) so that clients older than 4.0.0 will
  be unaffected and continue to use the original networking code as if the EF_UseNetworkMulti
  flag was never set.

03-01-2009, Dwayne1988 (Script pack)
- Updated: spherechar_human.scp, spherechar_evil.scp (Axis Tags were messed up, came after

- Added: UVAL, which works like EVAL, but for unsigned values.

01-02-2009, Shadow Dragon
- Added: Basic LIST support.

  use that item." being sent to players as they try to free themselves from spider webs.
- Added #1564: PetsInheritNotoriety setting to sphere.ini. This can be used to specify which
  notoriety flags a pet will inherit from its master (so if for example a pet has an evil owner
  and the NotoEvil flag is set then the pet will also show as evil regardless of its real notoriety).

22-02-2009, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1575: Improved handling of unicode speech in Linux build.

22-02-2009, nazghul

  character it was used on; ARROWQUEST without arguments (to remove the quest arrow)
  clears these tags. 
- Added: Character trigger @UserQuestArrowClick now has ARGN2 (x-ccord) and ARGN3 (y-coord).
  Just rightclicking the arrow does not clear the tags mentioned above, so the quest arrow
  can be restarted by script if the user illegitimely switched it off

26-02-2009, MrSugarCube
- Modified #1560: Separated PROMPTCONSOLE from the targeting system. Targeting no longer interferes

  when precasting is enabled.
- Modified: Separated the movement behaviour of the MAGICF_PRECAST flag into a new MAGIC_FREEZEONCAST
  flag. Enable MAGICF_PRECAST to enable casting before targeting, and enable MAGICF_FREEZEONCAST to
  prevent characters from moving whilst casting (enable both to retain the previous behaviour of
  MAGICF_PRECAST). Also added SPELLFLAG_NOFREEZEONCAST to disable the effects of MAGICF_FREEZEONCAST
  for individual spells.

06-05-2009, MrSugarCube
- Added #1599: SpellTimeout setting to Sphere.ini. If set to a value greater than zero then when
  casting a spell the player is given this many seconds to choose a target before the spell is
  automatically cancelled.

16-05-2009, MrSugarCube
- Modified #1610: Cure spell just sends the packet needed to update the health bar rather than sending
  a full refresh of the entire screen.
- Added #1609: MAGICF_SUMMONWALKCHECK flag to ensure that summoned creatures can only be successfully

- Updated: sphere_msgs.scp (Added msg_summon_invalidtarg defmessage)

18-05-2009, MrSugarCube
- Added #1466: MAGICF_NOFIELDSOVERWALLS flag to enable additional checks when casting field spells to
  prevent them from passing through blocking objects (CAN_I_BLOCK and/or CAN_I_DOOR).

20-05-2009, MrSugarCube
- Added #1604: PROMPTCONSOLEU function. This is an alternative to the PROMPTCONSOLE which enables the
  client to respond with unicode text.
- Added: SYSMESSAGELOCEX, an extended version of SYSMESSAGELOC which can be used for sending localized
  messages to clients with a non-localized string attached to the start or end of the message. SMSGLEX
  can also be used as a shortcut.
  Syntax is: "SYSMESSAGELOCEX color,clilocid,flags,affix[,arguments]"
  All arguments must be separated by a comma ",". Specify -1 for color if you do not wish to override
  it. Known possible values for flags are:
    0x00 = Append text to message
    0x01 = Prepend text to message
    0x02 = Forces message to show as a system message
  A couple of examples of this being used (latest clilocs) are:
   "SYSMESSAGELOCEX -1,1008078,01,MrSugarCube"                    - Displays "MrSugarCube : Attempting to heal you."
   "SYSMESSAGELOCEX -1,3002003,00,Smoking is bad for your health" - Displays "Note to self:  Smoking is bad for your health"
  For overriding messages in sphere_msgs.scp (or other message functions such as SAY and MESSAGE) the
  syntax "@hue,font,3 clilocid,flags,affix[,arguments]" can be used, for example:
   "SAY @022,,3 1008097,01,MrSugarCube"                           - Object says "MrSugarCube : poisoned you!" in red

30-05-2009, Nazghul
- Fixed: @GetHit always gave damagetype type (argn2) 0C02 (physical | slash | pierce). Now the type is set 
  to dam_physical, dam_slash or dam_pierce is added depending on weapon type (wrestling and mace weapons
  don't set extra flags).
- Added: TAG.OVERRIDE.DAMAGETYPE for weapon type items. Holds a numerical value and overrides the
  type specific damage type.

20-06-2009, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1617: Dispel and Mass Dispel spells sending an unnecessary full client update to all players

  character's weapon.

30-08-2009, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp (Added SKF_RANGED definition)

07-09-2009, MrSugarCube

  contains *basic* definitions for items in tiledata.mul that have no corresponding
  Sphere script.

12-09-2009, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1623: RESTEST requiring 1 of an item when checking for a quantity of 0. This also
  affects other resource-list-based functions and properties such as CONSUME, FOODTYPE,
  RESOURCES, SKILLMAKE, SKILLTEST, etc.
- Fixed #1655: Setting RAINCHANCE and COLDCHANCE to zero does did not disable rain or snow.
- Modified: When loading a WORLD* block from a save Sphere can resolve defnames to find the
  object being loaded (like the ones in sphere_backward_compatibility.scp, for example).

12-09-2009, Coruja (Script pack)
- Updated #1645: sphere_template_vend.scp, sphere_item_resources.scp, spherechar_human.scp,
  sphere_item_provisions_potions.scp, sphere_backward_compatibility.scp (Corrected spelling
  of the wyrm heart defname (i_reag_worm_heart->i_reag_wyrm_heart))
- Updated #1654: sphere_defs.scp (Adjusted height of the Meer characters)

13-09-2009, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1595: @Destroy trigger not being fired for items inside removed containers. When
  returning 1 in @Destroy on an item inside a container about to be deleted, the item will
  be dropped to the ground (unless the item has already been moved elsewhere).

  type.

05-12-2009, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Unable to connect to remoteadmin from telnet clients that operate in 'line mode'
  and need the enter key to be pressed after CTRL+A/Space (the one in Ubuntu, for example).
- Modified: Rewritten networking system, based on the code Vjaka wrote for 0.57 combined
  with updates added since such as EF_UseNetworkMulti. This new system introduces features
  such as packet prioritisation which should help to keep clients responsive even in areas
  with a large number of objects.
  The EF_UseNetworkMulti and EF_UseNetworkMultiVersion experimental flags have been removed
  from the ini and different settings have been added to a new "Network Behaviour" section.
  The default settings should suit most users, but in some cases it may help to tweak the
  MaxPacketsPerTick and MaxQueueSize settings.

06-12-2009, MrSugarCube
- Added: Support for gargoyle character creation. For the option to be available the player
  must have a RESDISP of 7+ and the FEATURE_SA_UPDATE flag needs to be enabled in Sphere.ini.
  ARGN3 in the f_onchar_create (sphere_serv_trigger.scp) is now the character race (1=human,
  2=elf, 3=gargoyle).
- Added: Basic support for mysticism spellbook and skill (the actual spell effects need to be
  scripted).
- Added #1657: Support for the increased tiledata size in client 7.0.0+. As a consequence,
  multis must now start from 08000 instead of 04000 and scripts must be adjusted accordingly
  (the default script pack has been updated). If an older client encounters an item within the
  04000-07fff range they will only see a worldgem bit (01ea7).
- Fixed #1661: Status bar not correctly showing green or yellow in 7.0.0+ clients.
- Modified: The size of Map5.mul is now automatically detected.

06-12-2009, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Added: spherechar_sa.scp (Added gargoyle character definitions)
- Added: sphere_item_provisions_alchemy_magic_sa.scp (Added mysticism spellbook and scrolls)
- Added: sphere_map5.scp, sphere_map_points5.scp (Added SA map areas)
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp (Added defnames for RDS_SA RESDISP, t_spellbook_mystic)
- Updated: sphere_serv_triggers.scp (Updated description for f_onchar_create)
- Updated: sphere_skills.scp (Added base definitions for mysticism, imbuing and throwing skills)

  commented out by default)

12-12-2009, MrSugarCube
- Added: Support for gargoyle flying ability. Flying characters will have statf_hovering set
  on their FLAGS property and will be allowed to pass over items that have the CAN_I_HOVER
  flag set.
  The exact effects of the statf_hovering flag are:
   - Can pass over hidden 'hover over' tiles to get to special areas
   - Can move at the same speed as a mounted player
   - Height is increased by 4 in LOS/movement checks (same effects as when mounted)
   - When stamina is lost on movement, the running penalty is always applied
   - Always revealed when moving whilst hidden
   - Will not teleport off ships when moving on to a ship plank
- Added: MULTIDEF block. This can be used to safeguard against any future changes to the size
  of tiledata.mul. This basically acts as a 'shortcut' for ITEMDEF, except the ID will 
  automatically be increased by 08000. Items defined with this are still accessible as normal
  via SERV.ITEMDEF.id(+08000)/defname, or SERV.MULTIDEF.id/defname can be used if you prefer
  for consistency.
- Added #1674: PINS property to maps, to return the number of pins on the map.
- Fixed #1672: Situations where returning 0 in a trigger would return as 2.

  sphere_item_provisions_armor_color.scp, sphere_item_provisions_deed.scp,
  sphere_item_provisions_ore.scp (Replaced custom script IDs with defnames to fix conflicts
  with new tiledata size -- some items did not have a defname so watch out if you have any of
  these in an existing world save)

13-12-2009, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1683: Hiding skill not properly updating clients to show the character is gray.
- Added #1678: Logging for commands issued via telnet. "TelnetLog" setting can be used

  successfully enabled.

20-12-2009, MrSugarCube
- Added #1667: PARTY.SETMASTER, accepts either a character uid or @<N> for the Nth party
  member, to change who the party master is. The character must be an existing member of the
  party and cannot already be the master.
- Added #1658: @TargetCancel trigger to spells (and @SpellTargetCancel to characters). This
  is called when a player cancels targeting with a spell.
    ARGN1 = the spell that was being cast
    ARGO  = the item used to cast the spell (e.g. a wand or scroll)
    RETURN 1 = suppress the cancellation message
- Added: @Wait trigger to skills (and @SkillWait to characters). This is called whenever
  Sphere wants to check if a character must wait before starting a skill. Normally this
  will be when a skill is selected from the skill menu (before @Select), but also when
  snooping a container or using a musical instrument.
    ARGN1 = the skill the character is attempting
    ARGN2 = the skill that is currently being used
    RETURN 0 = The character can start the other skill (bypasses default checks)
    RETURN 1 = The character must wait (bypasses default checks)
    RETURN 2 = Perform default checks

- Fixed: @TargOn_Cancel trigger not being fired.
- Modified #1687: Clients are now listed in order of newest to oldest.

03-01-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1700: Armor rating not updated when being resurrected.

  is called when a player cancels targeting with a skill.
    ARGN1 = the skill that was being used
    RETURN 1 = suppress the cancellation message

10-01-2010, MrSugarCube
- Added #1705: @RegionResourceFound trigger, fires on characters just before @ResourceFound
  is fired on a region resource (shares the same arguments and return values).
- Fixed #1706: Light sources not showing correctly on 7.0.0+ clients.
- Fixed: Guard command not working with pets.
- Modified: Pets default to guarding their master instead of following, and no longer attack
  the same target as their master when in "follow" mode.

17-01-2010, MrSugarCube
- Added: Experimental flag "EF_NetworkOutThread". If this is enabled then outgoing data will
  be sent in a separate background thread.
- Added: UsePacketPriority setting in sphere.ini. Leaving it at 1 (default) should be best
  but if this is set to 0 then [most] packets won't be prioritised.

24-01-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1713: Strange characters in the tip of the day window.
- Fixed: Previous and Next buttons not working on the tip of the day window.

04-04-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1734: No response sent for UOG and CUO status requests.

  by recording and displaying it for each thread.

17-04-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Wrong mapdif*.mul and stadif*.mul files being used with custom maps.
- Modified: If Map1.mul is present then it will automatically be used.
- Modified: The larger ML map sizes are now automatically detected, so there should be no
  need to specify it in the ini file.

25-04-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1725: Friends stealing ownership of a pet when mounting it.

25-04-2010, MrSugarCube (Script pack)

  boundaries.

24-05-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1756: Packets being sent for items in containers the client cannot see inside (A
  side-effect of this is that CANSEE/LOS will return 0 for such items, until the client
  opens/snoops the container).

25-05-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1754: Armor rating in status window not updated when equipped armor pieces receive
  damage.

- Fixed #1760: Players unable to see items in the other player's trade window.

13-06-2010, MrSugarCube
- Added: 'TooltipMode' setting to sphere.ini. When this is set to '1', instead of always
  sending a full tooltip packet for every item, Sphere will send a smaller 'header' packet
  and wait for the client to request the full information (for unchanged tooltips, clients
  can use a local cache and less data will need to be sent).
  Note: Since the header packet requires knowledge of what the tooltip will contain,
  @ClientTooltip should be expected to fire twice in this mode (once for the header, once
  for the full data). ARGN1 can be used to determine if the client asked for the tooltip,
  but it is important that you do not use it to change the tooltip content.
- Added: Support for caching tooltip data for characters and items. Whilst a tooltip is
  cached, @ClientTooltip won't be fired. A new 'TooltipCache' setting is provided in
  sphere.ini to control how long a cached tooltip will be valid for (set to 0 to disable
  caching). If the new tooltip mode is being used then enabling this would be advisable
  to avoid having @ClientTooltip fired twice for each client.
- Modified: RESENDTOOLTIP now accepts parameters to control how the tooltip should be
  sent.
  The syntax is now: "RESENDTOOLTIP [sendfull=0,usecache=0]"
   'sendfull' - 1 to force the full tooltip to be sent, or 0 to send just the header (when
                TooltipMode=1, otherwise the full data will be sent anyway)
   'usecache' = 1 to use cached tooltip if available, or 0 to clear the cache and force
                @ClientTooltip to fire

02-07-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Possible exception on Linux builds when an NPC moves.

03-07-2010, MrSugarCube
- Modified #1761: The fix for issue #1756 (sending packets for items inside unopened
  containers) must now be activated using the EF_FixCanSeeInClosedConts experimental flags,
  since it has been reported to cause client crashes.

28-07-2010, MrSugarCube
- Added #1776: P.COMPONENTS to access multi components at a location in the same way as with
  P.STATICS. Usage is identical to P.STATICS, except that the COLOR property does not exist
  for multi components. P.COMPONENTS.n.MULTI can be used as a reference to the multi that
  contains the nth component at a location.

06-08-2010, ShiryuX
- Added #1790: TAG.NOTO.PERMAGREY which sets the player's notoriety to neutral/grey.
  This will only happen if the character is blue, everything else will override it.

07-08-2010, ShiryuX
- Fixed #1772: Cooking skill wasn't counted as a crafting skill.

07-08-2010, ShiryuX (Script pack)

12-08-2010, ShiryuX
- Fixed #1793: OpenDoor Macro now won't ignore LOS and Distance is 3 (max).

15-08-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1722: Game clients unable to connect when the server IP is set to 127.0.0.1.

17-08-2010, ShiryuX

  This way you can call: "SERV.ACCOUNT foobar MD5PASSWORD f4d9ff51c527e8ef67d924d4f0a6db66"
- Fixed #1799: Accounts created using ADDMD5 won't cut the hash anymore.
- Fixed: Dialog properties xmfhtmlgump and xmfhtmlgumpcolor not working correctly with dorigin. 

19-08-2010, ShiryuX
- Modified #1786: Disabled 'r' console command to be used by remote telnet, use 'resync' instead. 
  Any other way to access the console (physical or remote desktop) can still use it.

21-08-2010, ShiryuX
- Added: Basic support for bard spellbook and skill (the actual spell effects need to be scripted).
- Modified #1800: @UserWarMode will now have ARGN2 parameter, which by default is 1.
  ARGN2 = 1 --> Will abort the skill action
          0 --> Will _NOT_ abort the skill action
- Fixed: SA Clients wasn't considered for Async connections.

23-08-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1796: Vendor speech containing the text "(null)".

23-08-2010, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_msgs.scp (Updated npc_vendor_s1 and npc_vendor_b1 defmessages)

25-08-2010, ShiryuX

- Added: sphere_item_provisions_clothing_sa.scp, sphere_item_provisions_armor_sa.scp,
  sphere_item_provisions_weapons_sa.scp (These files now contain all the default scripts
  for Stygian Abyss weapons, armor, clothing, jewelry, and other miscellaneous items.
  As a note: all throwing weapons use the t_weapon_sword type. There is no archery
  animations for gargoyles)
- Updated: sphere_skills.scp (Added FLAGS=skf_ranged|skf_fight to the throwing skill (Skill 57))

09-09-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1806: Possible causes of a critical "timer expired" error on Linux builds.

11-09-2010, ShiryuX

14-09-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1744,#1752: Desynchronisation of players' position between client and server.

27-09-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1819: "World save has been initiated" messages not being sent until after the save
  completes.

  behaviours or console errors.

30-09-2010, ShiryuX
- Fixed #1825: not writable books not displaying content for 5.0.0+ clients.
- Modified: Axis strip to use only ONE file to dump the stripped scripts (like TNG strip does)
  Commands are = TNG: "strip tng" or "tngstrip" (dump file sphere_strip_tng.scp)
                 Axis: "strip axis" or "strip" (dump file sphere_strip_axis.scp)

04-10-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Editing a book page can cause the following page to be deleted.

07-10-2010, MrSugarCube

09-10-2010, ShiryuX
- Added: "TAG.OVERRIDE.NOTO" and "TAG.OVERRIDE.NOTO.$uid" as notoriety flag overrides.
  TAG.OVERRIDE.NOTO is a general override for the notoriety flag.
  TAG.OVERRIDE.NOTO.$uid overrides the noto flag according to the viewer $uid.
  * NOTE: The general override is applied before the viewer tag. So it will override EVERYTHING.
          Usable flags can be found on sphere_defs.scp

09-10-2010, ShiryuX (Script pack)
- Updated: sphere_defs.scp (added noto_types defintion)

11-10-2010, Khaos (Script pack)

  the female name list)

- Added: Support for packet changes found in client 7.0.9.0.
- Added: Support for new tiledata.mul and multi.mul formats found with client 7.0.9.0.
  Since the tiledata size has increased again (supporting a maximum slot of 0FFFF),
  multis must now start from 010000. If multi scripts are already using the new MULTIDEF
  syntax then everything should work without any change to scripts.

14-10-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1832: Exception on Linux build when logging in.

18-10-2010, MrSugarCube

- Fixed #1838: Fixed "Bad MENU item id" error when trying to display a custom item in a
  menu or skill menu.

- Fixed #1782: Exception on linux build leading to sphere.pid file never being removed
  when shutting down Sphere.

27-10-2010, Khaos
- Added: Race selectors to newbie templates. Code works as follows: [newbie xxx <race>] Races
  that can be set are "human", "elf", "gargoyle", or leave it default for normal functionality.
  This works for the male_default, female_default, and all the skills defined in Newbie sections.
- Added #1598: All max* stat values (Hits, stam, mana, food) can be _safely_ set up to 1 million.
  Though you can go past this, we don't recommend it. Note: This should not be used on players
  max values, and we _highly_ don't recommend it.

03-11-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed: Exception on linux build when accessing guild functions without an SRC.

14-11-2010, MrSugarCube

10-12-2010, MrSugarCube
- Fixed #1854: LogMask setting not have any effect on the messages being logged.

12-12-2010, MrSugarCube
- Added #1865: ARROWQUEST function now accepts a third parameter to specify the arrow's id
  (defaults to 0). This can be used to display more than one arrow at once on newer clients,
  but bear in mind that older clients can still only show one arrow at a time and so the id
  will effectively be ignored in their case.
  If an id has been specified when showing the arrow, then you will also need to specify it
  again when you want to remove it ("ARROWQUEST" with no arguments will only remove the arrow
  with id 0).
    ARROWQUEST 1000,1000,0 // show an arrow pointing to 1000,1000, id=0

08-01-2011, MrSugarCube
- Added #1845: Support to automatically invalidate and resend tooltips when certain properties
  change on items or characters, via new AUTOTOOLTIPRESEND setting. See Sphere.ini for
  available flags that can be used to control which properties are monitored. Note that some
  scripts won't trigger the tooltips to resend (for example the 0008 flag won't detect a script
  that sets MORE1 on armour, so a manual RESENDTOOLTIP would still be needed).
- Fixed: Possible delay between sending packets required to display buy/sell menus.

09-01-2011, ShiryuX
- Added #1881: TAT_AS_FULL trigger type to TRIGGER function to set ARGO, ARGN and ARGS.
  Example: TRIGGER @MyTest,<def.TAT_AS_FULL>,01,100,200,300,here,start,my,args
           will call @MyTest with ARGO.UID=01, ARGN1=100, ARGN2=200, ARGN3=300

  trigger another tooltip resend if a monitored property changes during the resend.
- Fixed #1814: AutoResendTooltip setting not working when an item property is changed just
  before it is placed in a container (e.g. when the item amount changes during stacking).

10-01-2011, MrSugarCube
- Added #1872: Support for setting SPEEDMODE to 4, as handled by newer clients. This can be
  used to prevent a player from moving. Movement checks have been adjusted accordingly so
  whilst older clients won't understand this speed mode, Sphere will still block their
  movement attempts (with a slight 'rubber banding' effect as you'd normally get when freezing
  a player by other means).

11-01-2011, MrSugarCube

  used to enable client connections to be handled by separate threads. The NETWORKTHREADS
