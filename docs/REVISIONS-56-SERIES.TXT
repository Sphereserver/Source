Fixed: Importing items with same BASEID and different DISPID at the same place in world removes one of the items unexpectedly. This is especially the case for WSC imports, where same DISPIDs of the same BASEID are is almost always intended.

[sphere_defs.scp]: Added SOUNDTYPE_RAND, SOUNDTYPE_IDLE, SOUNDTYPE_NOTICE, SOUNDTYPE_HIT, SOUNDTYPE_GETHIT, SOUNDTYPE_DIE defs.

[items/sphere_item_deco_furniture.scp]: Changed defname of 03d8a from i_bed_ruined to i_bed_ruined_dupe, because there was already a i_bed_ruined (0c26), plus they look very similar, if not identical.
