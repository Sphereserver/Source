
---- 0.57.1 --------------------------------------------------------------------
---- Not released yet

18-10-2005, Radiant
- Wiped REVISIONS.TXT for 0.57.1. Old file is now named REVISIONS-56-SERIES.TXT

18-10-2005, Vjaka
- Removed: NTSERVICE, SECURE, FREEZERESTARTTIME, OF_Multithreaded.
- Changed: LOGMASK constants.
- Multithreading support has been heavily re-written. Now it should be much
  better and stable. Thread priorities and sleep times has been updated also.
- Exception handling redone, good valid debug stack information added.
- Changed: a bunch of error and warning console messages to show better info.
- Changed: resync now is instant task always.
- Removed: argument support for sector commands (respawn,restock) - if you wish
  the whole server to operate, prefix this with SERV.

21-10-2005, Vjaka
- Removed: EF_Minimize_Triggers, EF_New_Triggers. New way of allowing triggers
  is going to be implemented after some time.
- Added smart triggers minimize technology - triggers list is pre-created on
  server load and resync and only routines connected to the triggers defined in
  scripts will be used.
- Added 't' console command to get a list of triggers with their use count just
  for informative purposes. Does not work on telnet connection.
- Removed accounts auto-update file "acct.scp" as well as 'a' console command.

24-10-2005, Vjaka
- Removed: ForceGarbageCollect, SaveBackground, EF_Size_Optimize, now built-in
  to normal saves. Since now save trigger function are called only once, not
  per each sector, f_onserver_save_finished removed as well.
- Redone saves to be fully background. Since that separate statics save has
  been removed and saved along with the other save. As a side effect, now if
  the save will fail you will not get corrupted files anymore. Another side
  effect of joining all saves together is the fact the accounts storage is in
  the same folder where all other saves will reside. The speed of background
  save operations is auto-detecting basing on clients online to be as
  transparent as possible.
- Profiler updated to support threads and give more exact values.

04-11-2005, Vjaka
- Fixed: internal triggers list clearing on resync leading to trggers disable.
- Fixed: tooltip feature incorrectly treated value from ini file.
- Fixed: threads marked as frozen due to fast console on tasks like resync.

15-11-2005, Vjaka
- Fixed defmessage string allocation, thus binary EXE size reduced by ~200kb.
- Added a workaround of possible try to lock the same object from different
  threads leading to one of them being hang. The fix will avoid thread hangs,
  but can still cause some instability.
- Added #214: ColorNoto* settings for characters color hue change.

22-11-2005, Vjaka
- Since log output is protected from spamming with the same line, a nice unix-
  like feature added to display on the console (last command repeated x times).

01-12-2005, Vjaka
- Added #245: NPC names loosing their owners should get their wild names back.
- Added sector command LOCALHOUR giving local sector time in HH:MM format.
- Removed EF_Unicode, since it does not solve nothing really anyhow.
- Added notification if you have incorrect OptionFlags or Experimental mask.

06-12-2005, Vjaka
- Added #193 and expanded the way @Kill trigger works. The trigger is now
  called for all active fights for the character, not only for those who will
  be considered as killers, and have these arguments (read-only):
  ARGN1 - 1 if char is NOT considered as a killer
  ARGN2 - total number of people who are considered being killers
  ARGN3 - total number of people in war target list even if fight is not active
- Added #30: REGION.TYPE returning type from the itemdef of the multi.
- Fixed #54: Explosion potion had incorrect names if OF_AutoName was on.
- Fixed invalid walk packet parse from Iris.

07-12-2005, Vjaka
- Changed MySQL version linked with to 4.1.15 since 3.23 library was too old.
  You need to update your libmysql.dll for this change to work fully. Special
  checks and messages added for better control and usability.
- Added guild and player property PTS. No internal support for this, just a
  field for storing some guild/player rating points or something else.

08-12-2005, Vjaka
- Removed ExperienceSystem setting, since ExperienceMode is enough to enable.
- Fixed SHOW command working incorrectly.
- Fixed DB.execute giving exceptions when MySQL is not connected.
- OF_DiagonalWalkCheck, EF_Scripts_Ret_Strings now built-in executable.
- Experimental and OptionFlags values updated to leave no gaps inside.

24-12-2005, Vjaka
- Added AOS properties for player characters: RES* (cold,energy,fire,poison)
  with basic functionality, and LUCK with no built-in functionality.

28-12-2005, Vjaka
- Added support for 3d-client yawn and other animations.
- Added support for 13 special combat moves: ArmorIgnore, BleedAttack,
  ConcussionBlow, CrushingBlow, Disarm, Dismount, DoubleStrike, InfectStrike,
  MortalStrike, MovingShot, ParalyzeBlow, ShadowStrike, WhirlwindAttack.

31-12-2005, Shadow Dragon
- Added character tags Regen* (Str,Dex,Int) to modify regen rate.

02-01-2006, Vjaka
- Added easy quest support engine. Now you can add new quests just by adding
  a few simple configuration lines. Quests are accessable in scripts:
    General Lists:
  SERV.QUESTS    returns number of quests (full list list)
  SERV.QUEST.x.* accesses properties and functions of quest #x (server list)
  QUESTS    returns number of quests (client list/taken by client)
  QUEST.x.* accesses properties and functions of quest #x (client list)
  QUESTHIST     returns number of quests (client completed history)
  QUESTHIST.x.* accesses quest #x (client completed history)
    Quest Properties:
  COMPLETE      cliloc message: quest completed
  FAILED        is the quest failed (current quest)
  NAME			cliloc message: quest name
  OBJECTIVE     returns number of objectives (read)
  OBJECTIVE.x.* accesses objective #x properties
  PRIZE         returns number of prizes (read)
  PRIZE.x.*     accesses prize #x properties
  RESIGN        cliloc message: quest resigned
  SOURCE        sets source UID of the quest requestors
  SOURCE.*      accesses requestor's settings
  STATUS        returns status of quest (-1=no, <1000=index#, >=1000=history#)
  TEXT          cliloc message: quest description
  TIMELEFT      how much time left to complete the quest (current quest)
  TIMELIMIT     quest completion limit time (in seconds)
  UNCOMPLETE    cliloc message: quest uncompleted
    Quest commands
  CANCEL        cancels current quest
  FINISH        finishes the quest moving it to the history list
  START         starts the quest
	Objective / Prize Properties
  AMOUNT    amount of objects
  REF       id of the object
  TYPE      type of the list [OBJ:0=get,1=kill,2=deliver][PRIZE:0=item]
- Added character function TIMERF N,FuncName to cause a timed execution of a
  function FuncName in N secs. Specifying N as -1 will clear all TIMERF list.
  These functions are not saved, so do not store hours in the list, the purpose
  of this is to decrease overhead due to timered memory items opeations.

03-01-2006, Shadow Dragon
- Added tags to items. TAG.* (Alchemy,...) to increase/decrease skill when item
  equiped/unequiped. TAG.* (Str,Dex,Int) to increase/decrease stat when item
  equiped/unequiped.
- Added: Double click on self while in war mode opens paperdoll, not dismount.
- Added: Check if item isn't identified then don't increase/decrease skills/
  stats when equipping/unequipping it with magical TAGs. Due to this, item
  identification skill unequips item on success.
- Added character tags Regen*Val (Str,Dex,Int) to modify regen amount.
- Fixed: number below zero format, causing incorrect numbers in several cases.

04-01-2006, Vjaka
- Changed item TAG.<skill> and TAG.<stat> changing equip/unequip modifications
  to follow itemdef tags as well (will decrease tag usage).
- Fixed .xshow command defaulting to self instead of the target.

04-01-2006, Shadow Dragon
- Fixed: Death caused exception in sphere.

06-01-2006, Shadow Dragon
- Moved: Buy/Sell to scripts, so there is no need in @Buy,@Sell.
- Added: Vendor_BuySell.scp to scripts.
- Added: Trade* (Consume <arg>, Restest <arg> <res>, Rescount <res>) such as 
  Consume, Restest, Rescount, but without counting newbie items.
- Fixed: Newbie items lost their newbie status when stack with other non-newbie items.
- Fixed: Exception in tweak objects.

06-01-2006, Vjaka
- Added: SERV.console CMD to launch commands as you were in server console. Due
  to this, SHUTDOWN command has been removed (=SERV.console x#) or script it.
- Removed: PayFromPackOnly,VendorMaxSell since BUY/SELL is fully scripted this
  is useless.

06-01-2006, Furio
- Moved: Vendor_BuySell.scp to script57/sphere_vendor_buysell.scp
- Updated: spheretables.scp with line to load directory with 0.57 specific scripts
  (until 0.56b stable is out)

07-01-2006, Shadow Dragon
- Added: TAG.Freezed for script purposes. This doesn't allow char to move if 
  TAG.Freezed > SERV.Time.
- Fixed: Some fixes in sphere_vendor_buysell.scp script.
- Fixed: Exception when double click on items.
- Fixed: Bug when double click on some npcs caused calling buy menu dialog.

08-01-2006, Shadow Dragon
- Fixed: Pets going logout.
- Fixed: NewNpc creates npc in incorrect location.
- Fixed: Vendors doesn't restock after server reboot.

10-01-2006, Vjaka
- Renamed: TAG.Freezed is now called TAG.NoMoveTill - it's more descriptive.

10-01-2006, Shadow Dragon
- Added: Items in multis do not send to the client if he is not in the multi (OSI-compatible lag fight)

11-01-2006, Shadow Dragon
- Fixed: Bouncing items to your backpack while item identification from others.

12-01-2006, Vjaka
- Removed SectorSleep setting, the sectors speed will be adjusted internaly.
- Minimized ACCAPP settings removing only useful (see ini for details).
- Added argument for MOVE/WALK/RUN command BACK to move backwards.
- Added "NEWLOOT X" character function creating and equiping item X for NPCs
  if can give loot, useful to be used in @Death or @DeathCorpse triggers.
- Added "NEWGOLD N" function gives amount N of gold to the current char.
- Added "UNEQUIPLAYERS L,N" to unequip all items in visible layers into layer L
  (defaults to bankbox). If N is given, items linked to this uid will be not
  unequiped.

13-01-2006, Shadow Dragon (Script Pack)
- Changed: Scripted function GiveGold to internal NewGold in sphere_vendor_buysell.scp.

14-01-2006, Shadow Dragon
- Fixed: Some troubles in Item Identification skill.

15-01-2006, Vjaka
- Added a convinient SHOW/XSHOW output for ATTR and FLAGS. It now shows both
  hex and letter representation of the corresponding flags.

17-01-2006, Vjaka
- Fixed sectors not being awake if person was not moving inside, like macroing.

19-01-2006, Vjaka
- Removed UseGodPort ini setting, bind your extra ports via SETPORT command.
- Removed BlowFish and Blow-TwoFish packet encodings, thus clients lower to
  2.0.4 should be used in unencrypted way.

19-01-2006, Shadow Dragon
- Fixed: SHOW/XSHOW commands not working correctly.
- Fixed: Res* (Cold,Fire,Energy,Poison) not setting.

20-01-2006, Vjaka
- Removed [BLOCKIP] section, use f_onserver_start if you wish persistant block.
- Fixed several network issues, client freezing should be more rare.

24-01-2006, Vjaka
- Added possibility to configure some internal settings in sphere (like sysctl).
  The settings lies in SERV object and provides these settings:
  CONFIG.list - lists all settings with current values and description
  CONFIG.setting=value - sets new value for this setting
  <CONFIG.setting> - gets value of this setting
  The settings not saved, however, you can override them in f_onserver_start.
- Added -Ofilename command line, if specifyed the given file will be read as
  config settings. File should be in setting=value format, rest lines ingored.
- Moved some INI settings that are very rarely changed to the corresponding
  places in CONFIG in order to make ini file cleaner. This includes:
  TeleportEffect*,MaxLoopTimes,OverSkillMultiply,DeadSocketTime,LocalIPAdmin,
  ClientMax*,ConnectingMax*,SuppressCapitals,CommandLog,MapCacheTime,
  BackupLevels,CharTags,MountHeight.
- Added <EXPLODE sep,string> operator which converts string with separators
  other than ',' to commas making possible to operate with such string using
  strarg/streat. Sample: LOCAL.S=<explode :/- ,my:test/string:2-3> should give
  result of "my,test,string,2,3".

30-01-2006, Vjaka
- Added GMLOG command to log some information given in args to the separate
  file if the current char has plevel > 1.
- Renamed OF_NoHouseMuteSpeech to OF_HouseMuteSpeech and the action is reverted
  since most people like this disabled and have usual problems to search how to
  make it as it was before.

22-02-2006, Torfo
- prepared 0.57.1 for gcc compilation on linux

25-02-2006, Vjaka
- Fixed #470: Invalid argument for NEWNPC command will give dead man nearby.
- Removed defrag option since it was broken anyhow for a while. Instead, server
  uses some internal algourhms to decrease UID fragmenation.
- Added chat messages to be caught by global systemwide hearall.
- Fixed weird problem with some NPC verb testing.

27-02-2006, Vjaka
- Fixed dialogs closing immidiately after opening in some cases since function
  dialogclose in the beggining of it arrived to client after the dialog.
- Removed dialog button script execution when closing dialog using a script
  command. It was illogical there, but was left for some time for backward
  compatibility with oldest clients.
- Fixed NPC ai causing light source to flash highly at nighttime.
- Fixed items and characters requiring resend on reappear.

28-02-2006, Vjaka
- Sphere is now built with STLport, so require STLPORT.5.0.DLL or corresponding
  SO library to run. As a good effect, it will improve both the stability and
  perfomance of the system on cross-platform builds.

01-03-2006, Vjaka
- Fixed client freezing in some movement cases required resend to be issued.
- Modifyed light level to obey seasons, causing a slight diff in daylight.
- Added simple command line argument command support to sphere in the format
  "sphereSvr @ command [arguments]". Sphere will execute it instantly and then
  exit. Currently supported command is "region inputFile" to reformat map file
  from constants in "FLAGS=0*" to string representation.
  You can run "sphereSvr @" to get list of allowed commands and descriptions.
- Fixed exceptions sending packets with idle priority.
- Fixed reverted packet priorities causing not working overflow protection.

02-03-2006, Vjaka
- Added reformat to the list of available simple commands, currently useful to
  fix tabulation in scripts, more actions will follow.
- Added a 10-seconds delay in case a simple command was selected before exit.

11-03-2006, Vjaka
- Removed EF_Parse_Verbs since it is now built-in and executes when there is <
  character on the keyword left part

30-03-2006, MrSugarCube (Script Pack)
- Added a sphere_msgs.scp to the script57 folder containing all of the message
  definitions for Sphere57. The one in the main folder contains the 56b
  message definitions and shouldn't be used with 57.

24-05-2006, Vjaka (combined sync with local version)
- Added ATTACKER keyword to access last attackers for the character. Usage:
  <attacker>		returns amount of attackers
  <attacker.x>		returns UID of the attacker (or 0 if it does not exist)
  <attacker.x.dam>	returns total damage made by the attacker
  The list is being cleared upon death after @DeathCorpse trigger.
- Removed TRY and TRYP since they are no longer needed with autoparsing.
- Added ISWEAPON and ISARMOR read-only properties for items.
- Removed CONTROL as it is causing more problems that actualy solves. Hovewer
  a replacement for this command will be back once again.
  Note, that this and some other removed commands were made not because they
  should not lie on server itself, but mainly because their implementation is
  rather poor, that is better to reimplement it with some time, currently
  using old version for such functionality if needed.
- Removed RESDISP* since we assume we always have latest clients on the server.
- Removed AutoResDisp since we always assume we are latest.
- Removed AC,MODAC,STAMINA,HITPOINTS since it duplicates AR,MODAR,STAM,HITS.
- Removed AVERSIONS, not working anyhow anyway.
- Removed SLEEP, Statf_Sleeping and corresponding actions - it is buggy.
- Removed ACCAPP setting.
- Removed IMPORT,EXPORT,RESTORE,EXTRACT,UNEXTRACT commands, not really used.
- Removed VERDATA support.
- Removed sphereCrypt.ini since we are using clients >5.0.0 the keys are built.
  The reason why the support (temporary) is removed is to decrease problems
  due the fact that this version does not support old encryption, thus same
  file could lead to problems if used for both - stable and testing
  environments.
- Removed UseCrypt/UseNoCrypt/ClientVersion,Md5Passwords settings.
- Added GOLD command to count amount of gold for character, or set it (the
  corresponding items will be created at a moment).
- Removed NEWGOLD due to GOLD functionality.
- Removed INSTANCES.
- Added PROFESSION very similar to the SKILLCLASS currently.
- Fixed problem with spawns lossing the spawned npcs.
- Fixed several merged packets treating incorrectly, skipping some messages.
- Fixed problem with CALL command sometimes.
- Fixed world save problem with invalid in some cases.
- Added BETWEEN2 as opposite of between, which selected min<-cur->max to select
  towards minimum (max<-cur->min).
- Fixed items and status send when logging in and jumping on high distances.
- Modifyed pathfinder distance to allow radius of 4..24 steps to all directions
  being scanned, depending on INT/6 value.
- Fixed potential problem with pathfinding near the edges of the map.
- Fixed NPC walking through blocking obstacles.
- Removed FAME.* and KARMA.* constants. Use functions that will give real
  control for the functionality to you.
- Removed not-so-correct auto-detection of item type depending on tiledata
  flags. You should have all types specifyed in scripts due to this.
- Removed t_trap*,t_port_open,t_portculis types and traps support.
- Removed curse and bless attributes at all.
- Fixed dialogs taking tons of memory, and a memory leak inside.
- Added dialog verb "dynamic 0/1". If your gump is fully static (means, have
  no <keywords> and script constructions other than gump commands) it is
  recommended to set dynamic 0 in order to skip gump re-read from scripts.
  
15-06-2006, Furio
- Modified: Regen*/Regen*Val to OVERRIDE.REGEN_* and OVERRIDE.REGENVAL_* using
  numeric id instead of names.

19-06-2006, MrSugarCube (Script pack)
- Updated: script57\sphere_msgs.scp (Moved 32 hardcoded messages to defmessages)

02-01-2007, MrSugarCube
- Removed the "network.client.ping" setting from internal settings as it is no
  longer used.
