6/26/00 - 53g

ok , here's a basic outline of the change to the scripts sections SKILLMENU (SKILLS.SCP), ITEMDEF (ITEMx.SCP) and CHARDEF (CHARx.SCP)

get rid of BUYVALUE replace with VALUE=value for low quality, value for high quality
so the example VALUE=1,10 would mean that you would be able to buy from a vendor that likes you a low quality item for 1 and a high quality item for 10

get rid of SELLVALUE
 
remove RESOURCE=x items from [SKILLMENU x], put RESOURCES= in [ITEMDEF x] to replace the old (never used) MATERIALS=

remove TEST SKILLNAME=xx.x from [SKILLMENU x], put SKILLMAKE=SKILLNAME xx.x,SKILLNAME xx.x
for the specific item that is being made.
 
Now for the most difficult
Put item instance specific stuff after ON=@Create in both ITEMDEF and CHARDEF blocks.
so for example

other general pronciples of scripting:
try to put DEFNAME= toward the top of the [] block
try to use DEFNAME constants whenever possible instead of the hard coded numbers. (ex. MAKEITEM=04573 should be MAKEITEM=GOLDEN_CHAINMAIL_COIF

if fact
 
ONOPTION=04573 Golden Chainmail Coif (10 ingots)
RESOURCE=10 GOLD_INGOT
TEST BLACKSMITHING=28.6
MAKEITEM=04573 
 
should now be:
 
ONOPTION=GOLDEN_CHAINMAIL_COIF Golden Chainmail Coif (10 ingots)
MAKEITEM=GOLDEN_CHAINMAIL_COIF

...
 
[ITEMDEF 04573]
DEFNAME=GOLDEN_CHAINMAIL_COIF
RESOURCES=10 GOLD_INGOT
SKILLMAKE=BLACKSMITHING 28.6

CHECK "mislinked member uid" on guildstone at shutdown.
CHECK npc's call guards when attacked, 
CHECK kill count when attacking warring guild ?

Add -Tscriptfilename.scp to command line for testing.

changes to scripts SKILLMENU (SKILLS.SCP), ITEMDEF (ITEMx.SCP) and CHARDEF (CHARx.SCP)
get rid of BUYVALUE replace with VALUE=value for low quality, value for high quality
get rid of SELLVALUE

remove RESOURCE=x items from [SKILLMENU x], put RESOURCES= in [ITEMDEF x] to replace MATERIALS=
remove TEST SKILLNAME=xx.x from [SKILLMENU x], put SKILLMAKE=SKILLNAME xx.x,SKILLNAME xx.x

Put item instance specific stuff after ON=@Create in ITEMDEF and CHARDEF blocks.

remove POTIONDEFS in favor of just creating new items !

6/5/2000
[AREA x] blocks may now have TAG.x extensions
TAG.GUARDOWNER
TAG.ANNOUCEMENT
TAG.GUARDID=0 = no auto spawned guards.
TAG.GUARDID=xxx = some other guard body.

5/31/2000
More resource scripting. New types seem to be working.
Create new TAG. extensions for all Chars. saved in world file.

// support old versions that just had special files with [xxxx] entries
// DEFS.SCP - has no section headers, need DEFNAME header.
// MENU.SCP changes headers for ITEMMENU GMMENU, GUILDMENU and ADMIN
// SKILL.SCP needs new SKILLMENU header
// HELP.SCP needs HELP header.
// NEWB.SCP needs NEWBIE header
// NAME.SCP needs NAMES header.
//
// These convert automatically.
// ITEM.SCP needs ITEMDEF header
// CHAR.SCP needs CHARDEF header.
// TEMPLATE.SCP needs TEMPLATE header
// SPEE.SCP needs SPEECH header
//
// MAP.SCP LOCAL has changed to DEFNAME

5/25/2000
Change the scripts to use the new unified format!
SPHERE.INI, SPHERETABLE.SCP are read in at startup
All other SCP files in the directory and scripts directory will be pre-indexed for resources.
in the future direct number id for items and chars are to only be used for client artwork purposes.
But we prefer that the DEFNAME= be used instead.
indexing will occur in listed order. newer duplicates will replace older ones.
Non specific entries will just modify the older entries.
Default all numbers to decimal unless preceded by 0, (then it's hex)

5/15/2000 - .52d

add SECTOR.SEASON x or REGION.SECTORS SEASON x
FIX - not check crim flag on harmless stuff.

Main log server will list itself. (ie. BS2)
FIX stupid { -100 -200 } range problem. KARMA=-100 -200 is not working.

New Ref for all TOPOBJ

CHECK- can't send email to hotmail accounts ?

 No external web server app is required.
 Only web pages listed in SPHERE.INI will be served.
 WebPages without a WEBPAGEDST will be generated on demand.
 Define WEBPAGEDST and not WEBPAGESRC to serv up pages not generated by the server.

September 3, 1999 Revision Notes:
As of this release all default vendors have been tested and none are selling unpriced or inappropriate items like rocks.  We are still getting reports of rocks in loot and have narrowed the problem down to magical random items. We're going to be changing how magical items are generated, so look for more notes later.  Please report any bugs at www.menasoft.com/tus


*ITEMS:
Growing Reagents, Contributed by Aphrodite! Thanks!
Added Growing Reagents to the items file (they're triggers, but see the items file.) You can grow and harvest these reagents -- and they may be used as reagents.  These properties were added to the default "growing" items themselves so if you have other triggers or purposes for these items, make sure that you're only making your changes to the tusitems2.scp file or your original work may not function properly.
