**** The FILE obj **************************************************************************
FILE object permit the manipulation of a file. For the momnet is limited to one file at time
but if the test goes well a FILE[x] will be added. To access file function you should use
FILE.x or <FILE.x>. Some of the function/props can be used only when a file is opened, if
they're usable everytime will be signaled with a (*).

MODE.APPEND (r/w)(*) = File to open in append mode (this override read and write flag)
MODE.CREATE (r/w)(*) = File to open need to be created or overwrited (this override append, read
					and write flag)
MODE.READFLAG (r/w)(*) = File to open in read only mode (the file should already exist).
MODE.WRITEFLAG (r/w)(*) = File to open in write only mode (the file should already exist).
MODE.SETDEFAULT (w)(*) = File object with Append mode on.

OPEN (r) = Open a file. Return true if opened. Ex: <FILE.OPEN file>
INUSE (r)(*) = Check if FILE obj is in use.
ISEOF (r) = Check if we're at the end of file.
LENGTH (r) = Return the length of file.
POSITION (r) = Position of the r/w pointer in the file.
READBYTE (r) = Read n bytes from file and return them as string. Ex: <FILE.READBYTE 5>
READCHAR (r) = Read one byte from file and return it as number.
READLINE (r) = Read a line from the file. Accept as argument the line to read. It doesn't
				alter the position of the r/w pointer in the file. Ex: <FILE.READLINE 5> 
				will read the 5th line of the file. Special case is <FILE.READLINE 0> that'll
				return the last line.
SEEK (r) = It'll move th postion of the r/w pointer at the specified position. Special cases
			are <FILE.SEEK BEGIN> (move to begin of file) and <FILE.SEEK END> (move to end)
WRITE (w) = Write a string to the file.
WRITECHR (w) = Write a char to the file. The char must be inputted with it's ascii value.
WRITELINE (w) = Write a string with \n at the end.
FILELINES (r)(*) = Return the number of lines contained in a file. Usage 
					<FILE.FILELINES test.txt>
FILEPATH (r) = Return filapath+filename of the file opened
CLOSE (w) = Close the file currently opened.
DELETEFILE (w)(*) = Delete the file supplied as argument. Warning: if the file to delete is
					the one opened, it'll be not deleted.
FLUSH (w) = Flush the buffers associated to the file. Use it at your own risk.

**** Settings in sphere.ini **************************************************************** 
Please review default sphere.ini, especially the OptionFlags= and Experimental=
settings with it comments. They DO CHANGE from version to version, thus make
SURE that you are using the values you really need.

Features= // Flags for options that affect the clients upon connection
//   0001 - (T2A) enables chatbutton
//   0002 - (LBR) enables LBR sound (plays MP3s instead of MIDI)
//   0004 - (T2A) enables T2A update
//   0008 - (LBR) enables LBR update (shows monsters)
Suggested value: Features=0E
Default value:	Features=05

FeaturesLogin= // Flags for options that affect AoS clients upon connection
(Only with EF_AgeOfShadows)
// Send/Request Logout		= 002
// One char only (Siege)	= 004
// Npc Menu Popup			= 008
// Unknown					= 010
// Tooltip/Fight Books		= 020
Suggested value (if AoS is enabled): FeaturesLogin=028
Default value:	FeaturesLogin=00

NOTE: Do not enable AOS features if you plan that T2A/LBR clients will be used
by clients of your server.

**** Things to pay attention in scripts ****************************************************** 

- RETURN values
  Make sure you include an "eval" in your return, wherever you're not returning a plain number,
  a defname or a string. Instead of doing "return 1+1"  do  "return <eval 1+1>".

- NEWNPC, NEWITEM, NEWDUPE
  You can now call these verbs from within item triggers, and the new object can be referenced
  via "NEW". When using these on characters, ACT will also be changed. You can use
    SERV.NEWNPC, SERV.NEWITEM and SERV.NEWDUPE anywhere, and only NEW will be changed.
  Preferably, always include "SERV." when using these commands.
  Example (simple trigger for an item that gives gold when dclicked):
    ON = @DClick
      SERV.NEWITEM i_gold
      NEW.AMOUNT 3
      NEW.BOUNCE




**** Skill difficulties and ACTDIFF.  ******************************************************** 

For most triggers where a skill is involved, ACTDIFF can be used to read/modify the current
difficulty. ACTDIFF makes sense wherever ACTION makes sense, seeing as it is associated to
the difficulty of performing an action.

ACTDIFF has no meaning in @SkillStart, because the difficulty for a skill is calculated
afterwards. You can enable the OF_Skill_DiffFirst, to make @SkillStart come first. This has
the (only known) sideffect of making @SpellCast come before @SkillStart, as is the usual.
@HitMiss is another trigger in which you can change ACTDIFF to a value equal or above 0
to hit an otherwise failing blow.

The way sphere interprets ACTDIFF is interesting. It calculates the difficulty, and if the
character fails the chance roll against that difficulty, ACTDIFF becomes -ACTDIFF, meaning
that you can always find out the initial difficulty, even on a failure. Settinf ACTDIFF to
0 always succeeds. ACTDIFF above your skill fails.




**** TRIGGERS: ********************************************************************************

"IN" refers to arguments supplied by the server.
OUT refers to values read back by the server, so that changing them within the trigger actually
changes some hard-coded behaviour.
RET refers to the return value and its effect. Note that there are 3 possible return values:
   return 1	RET_TRUE	Cancel
   return 0	RET_FALSE	Succeed
   return 2	RET_DEFAULT	( usually the same as return 0 ). It's also the same as
				"return2", it's the "default return". Unless otherwise specified
				it does the same as "return 0". If something is specified for
				"return 0", then "return" is different in that it does the default
				action.


**** CHARACTER TRIGGERS ******
@GetHit
  IN:	argn1		Damage being applied.
	argn2		Type of damage (see damage type flags).
  OUT:	argn1, argn2
  RET:	1		No damage is applied, cancels the action.


@HitTry
  IN:	argo		Weapon used.
  RET:	1		Cancel action, hit fails.


@HitMiss
  IN:	argo		Weapon used.
  RET:	1		Silently misses (no message is shown). Notice that changing ACTDIFF
			to >= 0 makes the blow succeed.

@Hit
  IN:	argo		Weapon used.
	argn1		Damage being applied.
  OUT:	argn1
  RET:	1		Hit is cancelled, damage not applied, @GetHit doesn't get called, etc.

  OUT:	argn1
  RET:	1		Fails to push target aside, movement fails, stamina is unnafected.
   	0		Default action, but show no message.


@SpellCast, @Start ( [SPELL x] section )
  IN:	argn1		Spell being cast.
	argn2		Difficulty to cast. If OF_Skill_DiffFirst, this value is passed to @SkillStart (and only then
			to ACTDIFF).
	argn3		DELAY for the spell, in ticks (10 = 1second).
	argo		Item the spell is being cast from (see @SpellSelect)
  OUT:	argn1, argn2, argn3
  RET:	1		The spell fails.


@SpellEffect, @Effect ( [SPELL x] section )
  IN:	argn1		Spell number.
	argn2		Skill level at which the spell is being cast (power of spell).
	argo		Item the spell is being cast from (see @SpellSelect)
  OUT:	argn1, argn2
  RET:	1		Cancels the action, no spell effect takes place.
	0		For spells with SPELLFLAG_SCRIPTED: succeeds the action, but no

  IN:	argn1		Spell being cast.
	argn2		Mana being used.
	argn3		1 if this is just a test (as in cancast) or 0 if actually casting a spell - this is called
			twice (once before the spell starts and once after it is successful, with different argn3 values).
	argo		Object the magic is being cast from. It's either the character itself or an item like a wand
			scroll, etc.
  OUT:	argn1, argn2
  RET:	1		The spell can't be selected.
	0		The spell can be selected, and no further tests are performed.
	2		Default (the spell can be cast if all normal tests are successful)

@Success ( [SPELL x] section )
  IN:	argn1		Spell number.
	argn2		Skill level at which the spell is being cast (power of spell).
	argo		Item the spell is being cast from (see @SpellSelect)
  OUT:	argn2
  RET:	1		Cancels the action, the spell fails.
  NOTE:			In @Success ( [SPELL x] section ), both SRC and the default object are the caster, one has to
			refer to SRC.ACT get the affected object.

@UserSkills
  IN:	argn1		Number of skill being updated, or -1 for the skill list window.
  RET:	1		No update is performed.

@SkillFail, @Fail ( [SKILL x] section)
  RET:	1		Do not perform a skill gain check for failure.

@SkillAbort, @Abort ( [SKILL x] section)
  This is a new trigger, that is fired whenever a skill didn't reach the point of completion, where either
  @Fail or @Success would be fired. This can happen if the someone starts a skill before finishing the
  previous, if ACTION=-1 is set or if the situation changes (eg, suddenly you lack reagents while making
  a potion - it doesn't count as @Fail, it's @Abort). Aborted skills don't yield a chance to gain due to
  failure. This alone solves many abuse situations.
  RET:	1		Silently abort the skill, do not perform the typical events associated with a skill
			going wrong (e.g., in the case of Magery, doesn't show the fizzle effect).

@SkillGain, @Abort ( [SKILL x] section)
  IN:	argn1		Skill number.
	argn2		Chance to gain (from the SKILL section parameters)
	argn3		Skill cap for this skill.
  OUT:	1		Do not gain skill (obviously, you can roll against the chance in argn1 and
			raise the skill yourself).
  NOTE:			ACTDIFF was the difficulty for using the skill. If negative, then the skill
			failed and this is a gain due to failure.

@NPCLookAtItem		(needs EF_New_Triggers activated)
  IN:	argo		Item being looked at
  RET:	1		Do not see the item, do not look at other items
  	0		Do not see the item, look for other items as default

	2		default (see the character, look for other characters)

@NPCActFight		(needs EF_New_Triggers activated)
  IN:	argn1		distance
  	argn2		motivation (if motivation is below 0, the NPC will attempt to flee)
  OUT:	argn1, argn2
  RET:	1		Do nothing this swing
	0		default, but skip hardcoded actions (breath/throwing)
	2		default
  Note:	After this trigger, the NPC will attempt to do hardcoded skills (breath/throwing), then
	it will try to use Magery, then Archery, and if it isn't appropriate to use either, use
	melee combat


@NPCActFollow		(needs EF_New_Triggers activated)
  IN:	argn1		fleeing? 0/1
	argn2		max distance

@DropOn_Char, @ItemDropon_Char
  IN:	argo		Item being dropped on the character
  OUT:	1		Do not drop, bounce the item back (if no container is set within script)

**** OTHER TRIGGERS ******

@ResourceTest		// for REGIONRESOURCE sections
  This trigger is called once for every resource listed in a REGIONTYPE, to check if the player (SRC)
  can get it. It is called only if the player meets the SKILLMAKE requirements for the item set in REAP.
  OUT:	1		Ignore the resource (works as if the resource isn't in the REGIONTYPE list)

@ResourceFound		// for REGIONRESOURCE sections
  This trigger is called after a resource has been selected and the resource bit has been created.
  IN:	argo		resource gem
  OUT:	1		Remove the resource bit and return as if no resource was found in the spot.
  Notes: If you .REMOVE the ARGO, you'll remove the resource bit, and thus the spot will be useable
  again. Otherwise, the resource bit will stay there, with amount set to 0, to specify there is no
  resource there (until it decays due to its own REGEN).
  This also yields different error messages.

This is a set of flags that you can find in the CAN section of items. Some are
derived from the flags above, although they are independant and affect only dynamic
items. The comments on these were taken out of the source code, and I wouldn't rely
on them. I'll replace them as I find better ones.

[DEFNAME can_i_flags]
CAN_I_DOOR		00001	// Is a door UFLAG4_DOOR
CAN_I_WATER		00002	// Need to swim in it. UFLAG1_WATER

**** AREA / ROOM changes ****************************************************************************
Areas / rooms can now be supplied in a different format, similar to ITEMDEF and CHARDEF:
   [AREADEF defname]
   NAME = ...
This allows the server to identify each area by an unique name.
If you want to convert your existing areas to this new format, the process is simple.
1) Launch the server as normal
2) In the console, type "d a" (without the ")
3) A new file, "map_all.scp" should now be created, copy it to the scripts folder.
4) Shutdown the server. Edit spheremap.scp and delete all ROOM/AREA sections, leaving only
   MOONGATES and TELEPORT sections.
5) Rename spheremap.scp (now only with teleporter/moongate data) to spherepoints.scp and
   rename map_all.scp to spheremap.scp.
6) Add an entry regarding spherepoints.scp to spheretables.scp

Alternatively, you can download the Script Pack, which already has these files.
