## Building
Project files can be build on Windows (VS, CMake, MinGW) and Linux (GCC, CMake).

Even using 64bit OS, Sphere must be compiled/executed in 32bit mode to work properly. Project files included on source code will compile it in 32bit mode by default.

### Windows
#### Visual Studio (VS)
* Open the project file `GraySvr.vcxproj` using Visual Studio
* On top menu, select the build configuration (Debug/Local/Nightly/Release) and click on `Build > Build Solution` to compile

**NOTES:**
* **VS > 2010 users:** When opening `GraySvr.vcxproj` for the first time it will request an update on project file, just click OK to update
* **VS 2017 users:** VS 2017 have an modular installation, it comes with just basic components and extra components must be installed as needed. To use Sphere source you must open **Visual Studio Installer** to install `Desktop Development with C++` workload and `Windows Universal CRT SDK` individual component

#### CMake / MinGW
You can compile using provided files.

### Linux
Some libs are required to compile/execute Sphere on Linux. Use these commands to install:

#### Ubuntu 12.x ~ 16.x
If your OS is 64bit, enable 32bit support using:
```bash
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```
If you're using Ubuntu 16.x (or later), the default package repository only have MySQL 5.7 (and later) packages but Sphere needs MySQL 5.6, so add back the old package repository:
```
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/ubuntu/ trusty mysql-5.6'
sudo apt-get update
```
Install required packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get install git
sudo apt-get install g++:i386
sudo apt-get install make:i386
sudo apt-get install libmysqld-dev:i386 libmysql++:i386 libmysql++-dev:i386
```

#### CentOS 6 / 7 - Red Hat 6 / 7
If you're using CentOS 7 / Red Hat 7, the default package repository only have support to MariaDB instead MySQL, so add back MySQL support using:
```
sudo rpm -Uvh https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-9.noarch.rpm
sudo yum-config-manager --disable mysql57-community
sudo yum-config-manager --enable mysql56-community
```
Install required packages:
```bash
sudo yum install git
sudo yum install gcc-c++
sudo yum install glibc-devel.i686
sudo yum install mysql-community-devel.i686 mysql-community-libs.i686
```

#### Get the source code and compile it
```
git clone https://github.com/SphereServer/Source.git
cd Source
make NIGHTLY=1 -f makefile
```
**NOTE:** Sphere source is also compatible with CMake compiler for users that prefer it over GCC

## Coding notes for new contributors
* Make sure you can compile and run the program before pushing a commit.
* Rebasing instead of pulling the project is a better practice to avoid unnecessary "merge branch master" commits.
* Removing/Changing/Adding anything that was working in one way for years should be followed by an ini setting if the changes cannot be replicated from script to keep some backwards compatibility.
