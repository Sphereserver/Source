## Project details

[Automatic builds](http://nightly.prerelease.sphere.torfo.org/)

## Building
Project files can be build with CMake for both Linux (GCC) and Windows (MSVC and MinGW), old project files are still present in the source for now.

### Ubuntu

Install mysql library
* sudo apt-get install libmysqld-dev
* sudo apt-get install libmysql++ libmysql++-dev
* sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev:i386

### Windows

Create a .sln file (If the project was not generated by CMake)
* Open 'GraySvr.vcxproj' file using Visual Studio, press Ctrl + S to save the solution and choose a name for the .sln file, use this file from now.


## Coding Notes (add as you wish to standardize the coding for new contributors)

* Make sure you can compile and run the program before pushing a commit.
* Rebasing instead of pulling the project is a better practice to avoid unnecessary "merge branch master" commits.
* Removing/Changing/Adding anything that was working in one way for years should be followed by an ini setting if the changes cannot be replicated from script to keep some backwards compatibility.
