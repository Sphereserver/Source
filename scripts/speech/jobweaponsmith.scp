ON=HALBERD
ON=BARDICHE
SAY=The Bardiche lasts longer in battle than the Halberd, but does less damage.

ON=NORSE HELM
ON=OPEN FACED HELM
ON=HELM
SAY=Of the plain helms available, a closed helm will provide the best protection in battle.
ON=BUCKLER

ON=CHAIN
SAY=While chain is more easily damaged than ringmail, it offers better protection.
ON=CLUB
SAY=Clubs are often the weapon of choice for stupid creatures.
ON=SCIMITAR
ON=CUTLASS
SAY=Only the scimitar equals the slashing speed of a cutlass.
ON=FIGHT
SAY=I always try to be prepared for battle, so I keep my armor clean and a weapon at the ready.

SAY=A pitchfork may be faster, but for my money, only a war fork is sure to leave 'em screaming.
ON=GAUNTLET
SAY=Gauntlets are better protection for the wrists.

ON=KRYSS
SAY=The kryss does more damage and lasts longer than the quick slashing butcher knife.
ON=MAUL
ON=MACE
SAY=In the mace family, a war mace or war hammer will hurt your opponent most.
ON=MAIM
SAY=Maiming is almost as good as killing. Almost.
ON=PROVISIONS
SAY=See a provisioner for supplies if you're going on a long battle journey.
ON=RING
SAY=Most rings are ordinary, but I have heard of special rings which increase one's strength in battle.
ON=SHIELD
SAY=The Chaos Shield yields more protection than the Order Shield.
ON=SKILL
SAY=Some weapons require great skill in a given area, like Swordsmanship, Fencing or Mace Fighting.
ON=SPEAR
SAY=Bah. Spears better for catching fish.
ON=STAFF
SAY=A black staff does more damage than a gnarled staff, but isn't as fast.
ON=SWORD
SAY=A long sword is my favorite weapon for damage and it requires less frequent repairs than the faster cutlass.
ON=TROUBLE
SAY=It seems you are expert at getting yourself into trouble.
ON=WEAPON
SAY=My favorite weapons are those which do the most damage!
