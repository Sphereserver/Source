				SAY Jhelom 'tis the very place to go if thou'rt looking to hire mercenaries.
				SAY An overabundance of mercenaries are found in Jhelom ... and the shops and other establishments that serve them that fight for a living.
				SAY My sister lived in Jhelom for near on two years. She didn't like it ... too harsh for her tastes. All steel and iron, no silks and satins.
				SAY There's only hard-edged rational folks in Jhelom. They've no use for mages, but a magic weapon or potion will fetch a fine price most days.
				SAY They need a fair amount of goods in Jhelom. They once tried to set up a colony - called New Jhelom - to grow their goods for 'em. It didn't work out. Now it's called Nujel'm and 'tis a nasty wicked place.
				SAY There's not a lot of natural good to be grown or mined at Jhelom. Rocky, thou knowest.
				SAY Jhelom? They breed and train the best horses in the realm. Famous for it.
				SAY 'T'ain't no horse better than a Valorian steed from Jhelom. Best war-mount a warrior could want.
				SAY Jhelom? Pah! 'Tis a militocracy. Only ex-generals can rule, or some such nonsense.
				SAY 'Tis very like Trinsic and Serpent's Hold. If thou likes one, thou wilt enjoy t'other.
				SAY Jhelom sounds dangerous to me. Everybody's armed and 'tis said they'll challenge thee to a duel for no good reason.
				SAY They're very daring in Jhelom. Good swordsmen and skilled riders.
				SAY Thou'lt do fine in Jhelom. 'Tis only cowards they despise.
				SAY Cannot say I care much for the ethics of Jhelom. Watch thy comrade's back, watch thine own. Paranoia, I call it.
				SAY I saw a dance from Jhelom once. 'Twas done in Britannia. Looked like hackin' and slashin' and kickin' to me. Take away the music and thou wouldst call it a riot!
				SAY Jhelom? Now there is a town without a lick of beauty. Sad, really.					ENDDO
